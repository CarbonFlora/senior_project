### Final Notes
According to the Caltrans RMDM (Ramp Metering Design Manual), there was a Deputy Directive that desired ramp metering for all new on-ramps (or something along the lines of this). So, we are probably going to have 2-lane on-ramps until the ramp meter. After the ramp meter, this would merge into one. Details regarding designing ramp metering is in the HDM.
