### Standards Changes
None

### Consistency Changes
As I have mentioned to you before, ramp control lines start on the ETW of the host road. I recommend using the offset tool to help outline the ETW for all roads and ramps. We need to ask caltrans if the ETW includes the bike lane or not. Thank you for bringing it up.

### Final Notes
We are going to install ramp metering on all the on-ramps. If you would like, please see the HDM 500-19 for ramp metering.
