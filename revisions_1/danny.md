### Standards Changes
HDM 504.2.4.a "Freeway Exitâ€”The design speed at the exit nose should be 50 miles per hour or greater for both ramps and branch connections."
	Currently, your off-ramp design speed are 40 mph at the first curve. Since the first curve adopts the exit nose design speed of 50mph, your first curve design speed should be 50mph instead of 40mph. All following curves in sequence does not have to be 50mph. 

### Consistency Changes
Round the design radii up to the nearest 10s place. It's not good practice to tell contractors that you very specifically want 629' when it's more professional to ask for 630' or 650'.

I really like your ETW in yellow, can you add the ETW for the ramps too? Should be a simple offset command and will do wonders for clarity. 

### Connect with local road through T-intersection?
Yes, usually this intersection would be created in coordination with the city. If you want brownie points you can make this intersection and "tee" it up with the grid system that currently exists in Banning. 

### Final Notes
Good job on making it look nice.
