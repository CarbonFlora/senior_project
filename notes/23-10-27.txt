Bridge Types and Bridge Components
Is prepared feasibilty type of strUCTURE fr project approval and envornmental document (PA&ED)
Preliminary cost estimate and working days estimate
id the idea of potential impacts
requested by the district design division
required when:
	new bridge
	bridge replacement
	bridge widening 
	bridge rehabilitation
	sound walls on bridge
	non-standard retaining walls
Bridge design needs at least 4-6 months to work on the project

Bridge Types and Bridge Components
	Cantilever Bridge
	Cable-Stayed Bridge
	Suspension Bridge
	Truss Bridge

	Tied Arch Bridge
	!! Precast Girder
	!! Box Girder

Earth Retaining System
	Cantilever Wall
		most common wall used by caltrans
		standard plan exists
	mechanical stabalized embankment wall (MSE) with precast panels
	MSE wall with Gabion baskets
	Soldier Pile Wall 
	Soil Nail Wall

### Senior Project APS
	project location Ramsey St
		Ramsey St Bridge
			This structure has been retrofitted before.
			Excavate using a tie-back wall to help widen the roadway
			We must replace the north end of the tunnel if we were to widen the street.

	Main Street Over crossing 
		widening on the right side or..
		widening on both sides and keep the alignment the same. 

	Apache trail undercrossing
		if widening, then tie-back wall is required to retain the soil and open the road
		very costly to consider anything
		
Standard according to caltrans and FHWA:
16 ft minimum vertical clearance over the freeway 

If the freeway needs to be widened, open abuntment is preferable. 
Make sure all structures are buildable.
