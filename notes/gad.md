## GAD
### PURPOSE
confirm that the proposed geometrics will beet the purpose and need
ensure proper appliation of design standards
set the project footprint
determine right of way
establish horizontal and vertical alignments
id major design elements like structures, side slopes, sidewalks, bike lanes
minimize design risks during the design phase
