waiting for justine for row and topo files for design
working on overall schedule still
city and casino hasn't responded yet

	This will be an update presentation
	separate slides for each day.
	EVERYONE WILL BE PRESENTING not just the leads

		We can demolish the Caltrans office in the area for the real estate
		Please see the lead meeting today for more alternatives
	Main - 
		Diverging Diamond Interchange
		scissors shaped interchange where the circle ramps are on the east
			the freeflow is the best towards LA
			the trip generation will go on steroids
Design:
80% 20% traffic flow.
Oct 27 could be when we select the alternatives
gad is required for every alternative
4 alternatives is required for each interchange
up is cheaper than going down
the area is literally sand and in a liquefaction zone
floodplan is also going to be a consideration
500 year storm consideration
we are going to guess staging areas, but no staging plans
