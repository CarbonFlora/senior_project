### Alternative 3 (Eric)
[note: this is not comprehensive.]
- smooth the lines through increasing radii. Currently the design speed looks too low. 
- connect up the overcrossing North to the north side of Banning.
- R2:
	look into the curve near the intersection. looks too tight
- the ending slope for the ramps should match the roadway. ex. for the local road, it's 2%.
- there's a minimum grade of 0.3%. Should just shoot for 0.5%. Or match cross slope.

### Alternative 4 (Paul)
[note: this is not comprehensive.]
- consider the tangent length between your reverse curves. You need to account for the superelevation leveling. 
- R2 & R4, remove your excessive reverse curves. Convert to one curve is ideal.
- North of the overcrossing, square up with the City of Banning grid system with a curve and connect to the existing grid system. Ideally connect to a arterial or major connector.
- [tweaking] tighten up with the freeway to reduce retaining wall costs.
