## Notes for all design
- Connect up to Wilson St. Currently it's not terminating at Hathawy Street, but we can presume it can be developed to reach Hathawy. Ignore Morongo Rd, as this is a private access road and will be relocated by the city. You can design this as either a "T" intersection or right angle. We want to connect to Wilson St because it's classified as a Major Highway here page 54: https://www.ci.banning.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/663/GP-Ch-III-Community-Development?bidId=

## Paul
- Based off the Ramset Config diagram, create the line offsets.
- Take into consideration ramp metering. 

## Santiago
- Create corridors and superelevation diagrams for one alternative for now. Please work with Danny, Eric, or Paul to determine when they are finished with creating the ETW and ES.
- If it's possible given your time, create superelevation diagrams for Danny, Eric, Paul. You can either do it yourself for each alternative, or write documentation on the process.
