### Brief
This is a series of ideas you should review before presenting to Caltrans.

### Items
- If it's hard to see the alignments when you squint your eyes, you should increase the lineweights for the sake of the presentation. You can revert the line weights later if you want.
- label your ramps consistently with a number.
