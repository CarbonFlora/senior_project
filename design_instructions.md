Best Practices for OpenRoads	
	Microstation files don't contain Civil Elements like alignments and labels. For the purposes of design, we need to convert these Microstation files to OpenRoads files. For every design file, we need to use the "Seed2D - Imperial Design.dgn"[1] file in the Caltrans WorkSpace and Workset. 

[1] A Seed file is a completely blank design file with preset standards and styles.
	
Copy the 2D seed file from inside the Caltrans WorkSpace folder and rename the copy to the file you want created. This can also be done from the OpenRoads Homepage.

Ex. 2d Seed File -> ha_ramp_1_v0.1.0

After opening the newly created and renamed file, you must "civilize" the file. Please see the picture below on where this icon is located.
