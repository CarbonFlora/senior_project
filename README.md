# Senior Project i10
-----

## Purpose and Need
Provide safety and operational improvements along Interstate-10 (I-10) and its access points to accommodate the existing and forecasted travel demand, associated with local and regional growth, for the 2050 design year.
Improve the existing interchange geometry at the East Ramsey Street and Main Street Interchange.
Accommodate multimodal travel that integrates with the City of Banning’s General Plan, Cabazon Master Plan, and regional plans.

The nonstandard ramp alignments, ramp intersections, and the absence of the Westbound On- and Eastbound Off-Ramps at the East Ramsey Street interchange; The absence of connections for anticipated travel across the existing railroad alignment.

Gaps in the pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure impede the connection between the existing and planned communities at the East Ramsey Street and Main Street interchanges.

## Intro
Hello design lead 2 members. This will be the place where you can store notes and add issues you have when working with the project. The purpose this serves over traditional communication is that everything is archived. As one of the purposes of this senior project is to learn new things, the following software will help your design adventure:

## Tools
- Github <https://github.com/CarbonFlora/senior_project>
- Obsidian Notes <https://obsidian.md/>
- OpenRoads <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZMq_Rl0mR-iPBjUGhlKC6JhEDpwhSuXt/view>
- Learning OpenRoads <https://learn.bentley.com/app/Public/ViewLearningPathDetails?lpId=113831>
- Bluebeam <https://www.bluebeam.com/community/academic/>
- Google Drive (Personal Email)
- Highway Design Manual <https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/design/documents/hdm-complete-corrected-052022-a11y-020623.pdf>
- Ramp Metering Design Manual <https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/traffic-operations/documents/ramp-metering/202210-rmdm-a11y.pdf>

### Github
Github can be used to share small files on the internet. The feature we will be using primarily is the "Issues" tab found in the top-left. If you have any problems where you cannot find the answer to yourself, write an Issue under this tab. If the problem is larger than Design alone, email the PMs with [SPLEAD] in the subject line and CC me on the email. 

### Obsidian
Obsidian can be used to store notes in a more organized format. Obsidian uses markdown files to store your notes. It is possible to store photos, pdfs, and text in markdown files. Obsidian notes can be combined with Github to have a monolith note database. This means we all have the same collective set of notes.

### OpenRoads
OpenRoads is the drafting and modeling software we will be using. C3D is not used as dwg files are required to be transformed into dgn files. This may lead to data loss and increased time to design. Microstation is not used as ord files can be downgraded to dgn files.

### Learning OpenRoads
Bentley provides first party learning tools for OpenRoads. This specific tool assumes basic ability of modeling. See the Issues tab on the required sections to be completed.

### Bluebeam
Bluebeam is the pdf editing software we will be using. The following are instructions on how to install this software for students.
1. Click on the "Apply Now" button.
2. The Anticipated Graduation Date should be 05/31/2024
3. The academic department is "Engineering"
4. The 'I'll be using REVU for a..' is "Required for a course/module"
5. The comment is, "I'll be using Bluebeam for my senior capstone project for design sheets and traffic documents."
6. All the other fields should be filled out honestly.
7. Submit the form.

### Google Drive
Google Drive will be the general file sharing platform between the whole senior project. When directing another team member on the location of a file, take the following example as reference:

06 - Joint Design Teams -> 1 - Design Team 2 (Zi) -> 00 - Resources -> [File Specified]
Should be simplified to..
06.1.00.[File Specified]

Replace the placeholder [File Specified] with the actual name of the file.

How to setup Google Drive for the desktop:
1. Download Google Drive for Desktop: <https://www.google.com/drive/download/>
2. Follow the prompts to install and login through the browser once it finishes installing.
3. Go back to your Google Drive on the web browser.
4. Create a shortcut of our senior project by right click > organize > add shortcut to drive.  Add directly to My Drive. Now, a shortcut folder link is on the Google Drive in the file explorer.  

### Highway Design Manual
The Caltrans Highway Design Manual will be one of the criteria used for the design portion of this project. The most important sections are 200, 300, and 500.
