## Design Speed
100-2 | Local facility design speed connected to freeway 35 mph minimum, 45 desired.
100-3 | Design Speeds for Freeways, Highways, Local Facilities

## Intersection
200-35 | Access openings can't be within 1/2 mile of public intersection. Openings are directly opposite or <300' from median opening.
100-13 | Curb ramps should exist on all pedestrian street crossings.

## Section
100-9 | Sidewalk width 8' on main street. All cases, 5' If planting strip exists. 6' if no planting strip. Sidewalk does not include curb.
200-48 | Bridge sidewalk is >=6'.
200-48 | Pedestrian overcrossing width >=8'.
200-51 | Bridge shoulder width follows Figure 208.1. 4' minimum.
300-1 | Lane width is 12'. Class II bike lane width 4'. If adjacent to parking then 5'. If posted speed >40mph then 6'.
300-4 | Standard cross slope is 2%. 
300-6 | Standard shoulder widths on highways.
300-9 | Avoid curbs if posted speeds >=40mph.
300-17 | Ideally use a 4:1 side slope.
300-21 | Median width on freeway ideally is 46', should be >=36'. Rural is 62'.
300-22 | Conventional highway median width is >=12'.
300-45 | No permanent obstructions within 25' horizontal of CL of track.
400-36 | TWLTL (Two Way Left Turn Lanes) are to be 12-16'. Ideally 14'. 

## Horizontal
200-4 | Decision Sight Distance for off-ramps, stopping points, weigh stations.
200-10 | e_max for different roadways.
200-19 | 2/3L on tangent, 1/3L on curve.
200-24 | Design speed of successive curves is within 10mph. Avoid changing design speed at the end of high approach speeds.
200-25 | Avoid compound curves. Avoid Broken Back Curves. See 203.
200-25 | Tangent between reverse curves is 2/3L + 2/3L of each curve. Total should be greater than 400'.
200-40 | When lane is dropped, taper is W*V (Width of Lane * Design Speed). For >45mph, use 50:1.
200-50 | If posted speed >= 45mph, barrier separation required between road and sidewalk.
400-18 | Use the turning templates for intersection design.
400-27 | Minimum corner sight distance calculations and equation.
400-31 | Standard left-turn channelization with a bay taper. Taper is 60-120'.
500-1 | Minimum interchange spacing is 1 mile in urban, 2 miles outside urban and freeway 2 freeway interchanges. Outside urban interstate spacing is 3 miles. 
500-2 | Partial(isolated) interchanges should not be used.

## Vertical
200-3 | SSD increased by 20% on sustained downgrades if >=3% & >1mile.
200-27 | Obtain Terrain Type from City General Plan. See min-max grades at 204.3
200-27 | Vertical curve length when A>=2% & D>=40mph is 10V. Otherwise, length is >=200'.
200-32 | Structure depth & depth to span ratio.
200-33 | Min vertical falsework clearance over freeway & nonfreeway is 15'.
200-48 | Pedestrian undercrossing vertical clearance >=10'.
300-36 | Freeway vertical clearance is 16.5'. For others see Table 309.2A.
300-43 | Vertical clearance above rail >=23'4" for freight. 19' otherwise.
