# FOREWORD  
### Purpose  
This manual was prepared for the California Department of Transportation (Department) by the Division of Design for use on the California State highway system. This manual establishes uniform policies and procedures to carry out the State highway design functions of the Department. It is neither intended as, nor does it establish, a legal standard for these functions. The standards, procedures, and requirements established and discussed herein are for the information and guidance of the officers and employees of the Department. Many of the instructions given herein are subject to amendment as conditions and experience warrant. Special situations may call for deviation from policies and procedures, subject to Division of Design approval, or such other approval as may be specifically provided for in the text of this manual. It is not intended that any standard of conduct or duty toward the public shall be created or imposed by the publication of this manual. Statements as to the duties and responsibilities of any given classification of officers or employees mentioned herein refer solely to duties or responsibilities owed by these in such classification to their superiors. However, in their official contacts, each employee should recognize the necessity for good relations with the public.  
### Scope  
This manual is not a textbook or a substitute for engineering knowledge, experience, or judgment. It includes techniques as well as graphs and tables not ordinarily found in textbooks. These are intended as aids in the quick solutions of field and office problems. Except for new developments, no attempt is made to detail basic engineering techniques; for these, standard textbooks should be used.  
### Form  
The loose-leaf form was chosen because it facilitates change and expansion. New instructions or updates will be issued as sheets in the format of this manual and made available on-line on the Department Design website: https://dot.ca.gov/programs/design/manual-highway-design- manual-hdm. The new instructions or updates may consist of additional sheets or new sheets to be substituted for those superseded. Users of this manual are encouraged to utilize the most recent version available on-line on the Department Design website.  
### Organization of the Manual  
A decimal numbering system is used which permits identification by chapter, topic, and index, each of which is a subdivision of the preceding classification. For example:  
	Chapter 40 Federal-Aid  
	Topic 42 Federal-Aid System  
	Index 42.2 Interstate  
The upper corner of each page shows the page number and the date of issue.  
### Use the Table of Contents  
The Table of Contents gives the index number and page number for each topical paragraph together with corresponding dates of issue. If the holder of the manual chooses to maintain a paper copy, the holder is responsible for keeping the paper copy up to date and current. Revised Table of Contents will be issued on the Department Design website as the need arises.  
### Use of the Highway Design Manual in U.S. Customary (English) Units  
This Seventh Edition of the Highway Design Manual is in U.S. Customary (English) units. Departmental policy established by Director’s Policy 15-R1 and Deputy Directive Number 12- R1, both effective October 2006, state that the Department has adopted the use of the U.S. Customary (English) units as its preferred system of units and measures. All projects designed and constructed in English units shall follow the standards in this manual.

## Topic 62 — Definitions  
### 62.1 Geometric Cross Section  
(1) Lane.   
	a) Auxiliary Lane--The portion of the roadway for weaving, truck climbing, speed change, or for other purposes supplementary to through movement.   
	b) Lane Numbering--On a multilane roadway, the lanes available for through travel in the same direction are numbered from left to right when facing in the direction of travel.   
	c) Multiple Lanes--Freeways and conventional highways are sometimes defined by the number of through lanes in both directions. Thus an 8-lane freeway has 4 through lanes in each direction. Likewise, a 4-lane conventional highway has 2 through lanes in each direction. Lanes that are not equally distributed to each direction would otherwise be described as appropriate.   
	d) Median Lane--A speed change lane within the median to accommodate left turning vehicles.   
	e) Speed Change Lane--An auxiliary lane, including tapered areas, primarily for the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles when entering or leaving the through lanes.   
	f) Traffic Lane/Vehicle Lane--The portion of the traveled way for the movement of a single line of vehicles, both motor vehicle and bicycle.   
(2) Bikeways.   
	a) Class I Bikeway  (Bike Pat h). Provides a completely separated facility for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with crossflow by vehicles minimized.   
	b) Class II Bikeway  (Bike Lan e). Provides a striped lane for one-way bike travel on a street or highway.   
	c) Class III Bikeway  (Bike Rout e). Provides for shared use with pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic.   
	d) Class IV Bikeway  (Separated Bikewa y). Provides for the exclusive use of bicycles and includes a separation  (e.g., grade separation, flexible posts, inflexible physical barrier, or on-street parkin g) required between the separated bikeway and the through vehicular traffic.   
(3) Maintenance Vehicle Pullout  (MVP). Paved areas, or appropriate all weather surfaces, adjacent to the shoulder for field personnel to park off the traveled way and access the work site.   
(4) Median. The portion of a divided highway separating the traveled ways in opposite directions.   
(5) Outer Separation. The portion of an arterial highway between the traveled ways of a roadway and a frontage street or road.   
(6) Roadbed. That portion of the roadway extending from curb line to curb line or shoulder line to shoulder line. Divided highways are considered to have two roadbeds.   
(7) Roadside. A general term denoting the area adjoining the outer edge of the roadbed to the right of way line. Extensive areas between the roadbeds of a divided highway may also be considered roadside.   
(8) Roadway. That portion of the highway included between the outside lines of the sidewalks, or curbs and gutters, or side ditches including also the appertaining structures, and all slopes, ditches, channels, waterways, and other features necessary for proper drainage and protection.   
(9) Shoulder. The portion of the roadway contiguous with the traveled way for the accommodation of stopped vehicles, for emergency use, for errant vehicle recovery, and for lateral support of base and surface courses. The shoulder may accommodate on- street parking as well as bicyclists and pedestrians, see the guidance in this manual as well as DIB 82.   
(10) Sidewalk. A surfaced pedestrian way contiguous to a roadbed used by the public where the need for which is created primarily by the local land use. See DIB 82 for further guidance.   
(11) Traveled Way. The portion of the roadway for the movement of vehicles and bicycles, exclusive of shoulders.  
  
### 62.2 Highway Structures  
(1) Illustration of Types of Structures. Figure 62.2 illustrates the names given to common types of structures used in highway construction. This nomenclature must be used in all phases of planning.   
(2) Bridges. A structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads; and having an opening measured along the center of the roadway of more than 20 feet between undercopings of abutments or spring lines of  (buried) arches, or extreme ends of openings for  (buried) multiple boxes. It may also include  (buried) multiple pipes, where the clear distance between openings is less than half of the smaller contiguous opening.   
(3) Culverts. A type of buried structure without a bridge number, see Index 806.2. Any structure that fits the definition of a bridge shall be assigned a bridge number by Structure Maintenance and Investigation. Buried structures that meet the definition of a bridge but are made of a collection of culverts will only be considered as bridges for the purposes of design and structural maintenance record, not for definitions in specifications. Buried structures, with or without bridge numbers, covered by Caltrans Standard Plans can be designed by the District. Culvert modifications to Standard Plans can be designed by the District and shall be reviewed by the Division of Engineering Services. Buried structure with a bridge number but not covered by Standard Plans shall be designed by the Division of Engineering Services.

### 62.3 Highway Types  
(1) Freeway. A freeway, as defined by statute, is a highway in respect to which the owners of abutting lands have no right or easement of access to or from their abutting lands or in respect to which such owners have only limited or restricted right or easement of access. This statutory definition also includes expressways.  
(2) The engineering definitions for use in this manual are: a) Freeway--A divided arterial highway with full control of access and with grade sepa- rations at intersections. b) Expressway--An arterial highway with at least partial control of access, which may or may not be divided or have grade separations at intersections.  
(3) Controlled Access Highway. In situations where it has been determined advisable by the Director or the CTC, a facility may be designated a "controlled access highway" in lieu of the designation "freeway". All statutory provisions pertaining to freeways and expressways apply to controlled access highways.  
(4) Conventional Highway. A highway without control of access which may or may not be divided. Grade separations at intersections or access control may be used when justified at spot locations.  
(5) Highway. In general a public right of way for the purpose of travel or transportation.  
	(a) Alley--A road passing through a continuous row of houses, buildings, etc. that permits access from the local street network to backyards, garages, etc.  
	(b) Arterial Highway--A general term denoting a highway primarily for through travel usually on a continuous route.  
	(c) Bypass--An arterial highway that permits users to avoid part or all of a city or town center, a suburban area, or an urban area.  
	(d) Collector-Distributor Road--A separated freeway system adjacent to a freeway, which connects two or more local road ramps or freeway connections to the freeway at a limited number of points.  
	(e) Collector Road--A route that serves travel of primarily intracounty rather than statewide importance in rural areas or a route that serves both land access and traffic circulation within a residential neighborhood, as well as commercial and industrial areas in urban and suburban areas.  
	(f) Divided Highway--A highway with separated roadbeds for traffic traveling in opposing directions.  
	(g) Major Street or Major Highway--An arterial highway with intersections at grade and direct access to abutting property on which geometric design and traffic control measures are used to expedite the safe movement of through traffic.  
	(h) Through Street or Through Highway--The highway or portion thereof at the entrance to which vehicular traffic from intersecting highways is regulated by “STOP” signs or traffic control signals or is controlled when entering on a separate right-turn roadway by a “YIELD” sign.  
(6) Parkway. An arterial highway for noncommercial vehicles, with full or partial control of access, which is typically located within a park or a ribbon of park-like development.  
(7) Scenic Highway. A State or county highway, in total or in part, that is recognized for its scenic value, protected by a locally adopted corridor protection program, and has been officially designated by the Department.   
(8) Street or Road.  
	a. Cul-de-Sac Street--A local street open at one end only, with special provisions for turning around.  
	b. Dead End Street/No Outlet--A local street open at one end only, without special provisions for turning around.  
	c. Frontage Street or Road--A local street or road auxiliary to and located on the side of an arterial highway for service to abutting property and adjacent areas and for control of access.  
	d. Local Street or Local Road--A street or road primarily for access to residence, business or other abutting property.  
	e. Private Road or Private Driveway--A way or place in private ownership and used for travel by the owner and those having express or implied permission from the owner but not by other members of the public.  
	f. Street--A way or place that is publicly maintained and open for the use of the public to travel. Street includes highway.  
	g. Toll Road, Bridge or Tunnel--A highway, bridge, or tunnel open to traffic only upon payment of a toll or fee.   
(9) Throughway. A conventional highway or a suburban arterial in developed or developing areas, that is characterized by lower density  (not built out) land uses, adjacent undeveloped land or parkland, direct access to abutting property, at-grade intersections, and that may have shoulders with or without curb and gutter.  
  
### 62.4 Interchanges and Intersections at Grade  
(1) Central Island. The raised area in the center of a roundabout around which traffic circulates. The central island does not necessarily need to be circular in shape.  
(2) Circulatory Roadway. The curved roadbed that users of a roundabout travel on in a counterclockwise direction around the central island.  
(3) Channelization. The separation or regulation of conflicting movements into definite paths of travel by the use of pavement markings, raised islands, or other suitable means to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.  
(4) Convergence Point. The point of convergence occurs where the right ETW of the entrance ramp is one lane width from the right ETW of the freeway.  
(5) Crosswalk. Crosswalk is either:  
	(a) That portion of a roadway included within the prolongation or connection of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles, except the prolongation of such lines from an alley across a street.  
	(b) Any portion of a roadway distinctly indicated for pedestrian crossing by lines or other markings on the surface.  
(6) Geometric Design. The arrangement of the visible elements of a road, such as alignment, grades, sight distances, widths, slopes, and other similar elements.  
(7) Gore. The area between a through roadway and an exit ramp. This term may also refer to the similar area between a through roadway and a converging entrance ramp.  
(8) Grade Separation. A crossing of two highways, highway and local road, or a highway and a railroad at different levels.  
(9) Inscribed Circle Diameter. The distance across the circle of a roundabout, inscribed by the outer curb (or edge) of the circulatory roadway. It is the sum of the central island diameter and twice the circulatory roadway width.

	(b) Freeway-to-freeway Connection--A single or multilane connection between freeways or any two high speed facilities.  
	(c) Ramp--A connecting roadway between a freeway or expressway and another highway, road, or roadside area.  
(12)Intersection. The general area where two or more roadways join or cross, including the roadway and roadside facilities for movements in that area.  
(13)Island. A defined area between roadway lanes for control of vehicle movements or for pedestrian refuge. Within an intersection a median or an outer separation is considered an island.  
(14)Landscape Buffer/Strip. A planted section adjacent to the legs of a roundabout that separates users of the roadway from users of the shared use/Class I Bikeway and assists with guiding pedestrians to the designated crossing locations. Also known as “way finding.”  
(15)Minimum Turning Radius. The radius of the path of the outer front wheel of a vehicle making its sharpest turn.  
(16)Offset Left-Turn Lanes. Left-turn lanes are shifted as far to the left as practical rather than aligning the left-turn lane exactly parallel with and adjacent to the through lane.  
(17)Offtracking. The difference between the paths of the front and rear wheels of a vehicle as it negotiates a turn.  
(18)Pedestrian Refuge. A section of pavement or sidewalk, completely surrounded by asphalt or other road materials, where users can stop before completing the crossing of a road.  
(19)Roundabout. A type of circular intersection with specific geometric and traffic control features that in combination lower speed operations and lower speed differentials among all users immediately prior to, through, and beyond the intersection. Vehicle speed is controlled by deflection in the path of travel, and the “yield upon entry” rule for traffic approaching the roundabout’s circulatory roadway. Curves and deflections are introduced that limit operating speeds.  
(20)Splitter Island. A raised or painted traffic island that separates traffic in opposing directions of travel. They are typically used at roundabouts and on the minor road approaches to an intersection.  
(21)Skew Angle. The complement of the acute angle between two centerlines which cross.  
(22)Swept width. The total width needed by the vehicle body to traverse a curve. It is the distance measured along the curve radius from the outer front corner of the body to the inner rear corner of the body as the vehicle traverses around a curve. This width is used to determine lane width and clearance to objects, such as signs, poles, etc., as well as vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.  
(23)Tracking width. The total width needed by the tires to traverse a curve; it is the distance measured along the curve radius from the outer front tire track to the inner rear tire track as the vehicle traverses around a curve. This width is used to determine the minimum width required for the vehicle turning. Consideration for additional width may be needed for other vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.  
(24)Truck Apron. The traversable portion of the roundabout central island adjacent to the circulatory roadway that may be needed to accommodate the wheel tracking of large vehicles. A truck apron is sometimes provided on the outside of the circulatory roadway, but cannot encroach upon the pedestrian crossing.  
(25)Weaving Section. A length of roadway, designed to accommodate two traffic streams merging and diverging within a short distance.  
(26)Wheelbase. For single-unit vehicles, the distance from the first axle to the single rear axle or, in the case of a tandem or triple set of rear axles, to the center of the group of rear axles. See Topic 404  
  
### 62.5 Landscape Architecture  
(1) Classified Landscaped Freeway. A classified landscaped freeway is a planted section of freeway that meets the criteria established by the California Code of Regulations Outdoor Advertising Regulations, Title 4, Division 6. This designation is used in the control and regulation of outdoor advertising displays.  
(2) Park and Ride. A paved area for parking which provides a connection point for public access to a variety of modal options. See Topic 915.  
(3) Safety Roadside Rest Area System. The safety roadside rest area system is a component of the highway system providing roadside areas where travelers can stop, rest and manage their travel needs. Planned with consideration of alternative stopping opportunities such as truck stops, commercial services, and vista points, the rest area system provides public stopping opportunities where they are most needed, usually between large towns and at entrances to major metropolitan areas. See Topic 913.  
(4) Site Furnishings. Features such as newspaper boxes, bicycle racks, bus shelters, benches, trash receptacles, interpretive panels, art or drinking fountains that occupy space on or alongside pedestrian sidewalks.

(4) Business District (or Central Business District). The commercial and often the geographic heart of a city, which may be referred to as “downtown.” Usually contains retail stores, theatres, entertainment and convention venues, government buildings, and little or no industry because of the high value of land. Historic sections may be referred to as “old town.”  
(5) Condemnation. The process by which property is acquired for public purposes through legal proceedings under power of eminent domain.  
(6) Control of Access. The condition where the right of owners or occupants of abutting land or other persons to access in connection with a highway is fully or partially controlled by public authority.  
(7) Easement. A right to use or control the property of another for designated purposes.  
(8) Eminent Domain. The power to take private property for public use without the owner's consent upon payment of just compensation.  
(9) Encroachment. In terms of exceptions and permits, includes, but is not limited to, any structure, object, or activity of any kind or character which is within the State right of way, but it is not a part of the State facility or serving a transportation need.  
(10)Inverse Condemnation. The legal process which may be initiated by a property owner to compel the payment of just compensation, where the property has been taken for or damaged by a public purpose.  
(11)Negotiation. The process by which property is sought to be acquired for project purposes through mutual agreement upon the terms for transfer of such property.  
(12)Partial Acquisition. The acquisition of a portion of a parcel of property.

### 62.7 Pavement  
The following list of definitions includes terminologies that are commonly used in California as well as selected terms from the "AASHTO Guide for the Design of Pavement Structures" which may be used by FHWA, local agencies, consultants, etc. in pavement engineering reports and research publications.  
(1) Asphalt Concrete. See Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA).  
(2) Asphalt Rubber. A blend of asphalt binder, reclaimed tire rubber, and certain additives in which the rubber component is at least 15 percent by weight of the total blend and has reacted in the hot asphalt binder sufficiently to cause swelling of the rubber particles.  
(3) Asphalt Treated Permeable Base (ATPB). A highly permeable open-graded mixture of crushed coarse aggregate and asphalt binder placed as the base layer to assure adequate drainage of the structural section, as well as structural support.  
(4) Base. A layer of selected, processed, and/or treated aggregate material that is placed immediately below the surface course. It provides additional load distribution and contributes to drainage and frost resistance.  
(5) Basement Soil/Material. See Subgrade.  
(6) Borrow. Natural soil obtained from sources outside the roadway prism to make up a deficiency in excavation quantities.  
(7) California R-Value. A measure of resistance to deformation of the soils under saturated conditions and traffic loading as determined by the stabilometer test (CT301). The California R-value, also referred to as R-value, measures the supporting strength of the subgrade and subsequent layers used in the pavement structure. For additional information, see Topic 614.  
(8) Capital Preventive Maintenance. Typically, Capital Preventive Maintenance (CAPM) consists of work performed to preserve the existing pavement structure utilizing strategies that preserve or extend pavement service life. The CAPM program is divided into pavement preservation and pavement rehabilitation. For further discussion see Topic 603.  
(9) Cement Treated Permeable Base (CTPB). A highly permeable open-graded mixture of coarse aggregate, portland cement, and water placed as the base layer to provide adequate drainage of the structural section, as well as structural support.  
(10)Composite Pavement. These are pavements comprised of both rigid and flexible layers. Currently, for purposes of the procedures in this manual, only flexible over rigid composite pavements are considered composite pavements.  
(11)Crack. Separation of the pavement material due to thermal and moisture variations, consolidation, vehicular loading, or reflections from an underlying pavement joint or separation.  
(12)Crack, Seat, and Overlay (CSO). A rehabilitation strategy for rigid pavements. CSO practice requires the contractor to crack and seat the rigid pavement slabs, and place a flexible overlay with a pavement reinforcing fabric (PRF) interlayer.  
(13)Crumb Rubber Modifier (CRM). Scrap rubber produced from scrap tire rubber and other components, if required, and processed for use in wet or dry process modification of asphalt paving.  
(14)Deflection. The downward vertical movement of a pavement surface due to the application of a load to the surface.  
(15)Dense Graded Asphalt Concrete (DGAC). See Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA).  
(16)Depression. Localized low areas of limited size that may or may not be accompanied by cracking.  
(17)Dowel Bar. A load transfer device in a rigid slab usually consisting of a plain round steel bar.  
(18)Edge Drain System. A drainage system, consisting of a slotted plastic collector pipe encapsulated in treated permeable material and a filter fabric barrier, with unslotted plastic pipe vents, outlets, and cleanouts, designed to drain both rigid and flexible pavement structures.  
(19)Embankment. A prism of earth that is constructed from excavated or borrowed natural soil and/or rock, extending from original ground to the grading plane, and designed to provide a stable support for the pavement structure.  
(20)Equivalent Single Axle Loads (ESAL's). The number of 18-kip standard single axle load repetitions that would have the same damage effect to the pavement as an axle of a specified magnitude and configuration. See Index 613.2 for additional information.  
(21)Flexible Pavement. Pavements engineered to transmit and distribute vehicle loads to the underlying layers. The highest quality layer is the surface course (generally asphalt binder mixes) which may or may not incorporate underlying layers of base and subbase. These types of pavements are called "flexible" because the total pavement structure bends or flexes to accommodate deflection bending under vehicle loads. For further discussion, see Chapter 630.  
(22)Grading Plane. The surface of the basement material upon which the lowest layer of subbase, base, pavement surfacing, or other specified layer, is placed.  
(23)Gravel Factor (Gf ). Refers to the relative strength of a given material compared to a standard gravel subbase material. The cohesiometer values were used to establish the Gf currently used by Caltrans.  
(24)Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Formerly known as asphalt concrete (AC), HMA is a graded asphalt concrete mixture (aggregate and asphalt binder) containing a small percentage of voids which is used primarily as a surface course to provide the structural strength needed to distribute loads to underlying layers of the pavement structure.  
(25)Hot Recycled Asphalt (HRA). The use of reclaimed flexible pavement which is combined with virgin aggregates, asphalt, and sometimes rejuvenating agents at a central hot-mix plant and placed in the pavement structure in lieu of using all new materials.  
(26)Joint Seals. Pourable, extrudable or premolded materials that are placed primarily in transverse and longitudinal joints in concrete pavement to deter the entry of water and incompressible materials (such as sand that is broadcast in freeze-thaw areas to improve skid resistance).  
(27)Lean Concrete Base. Mixture of aggregate, portland cement, water, and optional admixtures, primarily used as a base for portland cement concrete pavement.  
(28)Longitudinal Joint. A joint normally placed between roadway lanes in rigid pavements to control longitudinal cracking; and the joint between the traveled way and the shoulder.  
(29)Maintenance. The preservation of the entire roadway, including pavement structure, shoulders, roadsides, structures, and such traffic control devices as are necessary for its safe and efficient utilization.  
(30)Open Graded Asphalt Concrete (OGAC). See Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC).  
(31)Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC). Formerly known as open graded asphalt concrete (OGAC), OGFC is a wearing course mix consisting of asphalt binder and aggregate with relatively uniform grading and little or no fine aggregate and mineral filler. OGFC is designed to have a large number of void spaces in the compacted mix as compared to hot mix asphalt. For further discussion, see Topic 631.  
(32)Overlay. An overlay is a layer, usually hot mix asphalt, placed on existing flexible or rigid pavement to restore ride quality, to increase structural strength (load carrying capacity), and to extend the service life.  
(33)Pavement. The planned, engineered system of layers of specified materials (typically consisting of surface course, base, and subbase) placed over the subgrade soil to support the cumulative vehicle loading anticipated during the design life of the pavement. The pavement is also referred to as the pavement structure and has been referred to as pavement structural section.  
(34)Pavement Design Life. Also referred to as performance period, pavement design life is the period of time that a newly constructed or rehabilitated pavement is engineered to perform before reaching a condition that requires CAPM, (see Index 603.3). The selected pavement design life varies depending on the characteristics of the highway facility, the objective of the project, and projected vehicle volume and loading.  
(35)Pavement Drainage System. A drainage system used for both asphalt and rigid pavements consisting of a treated permeable base layer and a collector system which includes a slotted plastic pipe encapsulated in treated permeable material and a filter fabric barrier with unslotted plastic pipe as vents, outlets and cleanouts to rapidly drain the pavement structure. For further discussion, see Chapter 650.  
(36)Pavement Preservation. Work done, either by contract or by State forces to preserve the ride quality, safety characteristics, functional serviceability and structural integrity of roadway facilities on the State highway system. For further discussion, see Topic 603.  
(37)Pavement Service Life. Is the actual period of time that a newly constructed or rehabilitated pavement structure performs satisfactorily before reaching its terminal serviceability or a condition that requires major rehabilitation or reconstruction. Because of the many independent variables involved, pavement service life may be considerably longer or shorter than the design life of the pavement. For further discussion, see Topic 612.  
(38)Pavement Structure. See Pavement.  
(39)Pumping. The ejection of base material, either wet or dry, through joints or cracks, or along edges of rigid slabs resulting from vertical movements of the slab under vehicular traffic loading. This phenomena is especially pronounced with saturated structural sections.  
(40)Raveling. Progressive disintegration of the surface course on asphalt concrete pavement by the dislodgement of aggregate particles and binder.  
(41)Rehabilitation. Work undertaken to extend the service life of an existing facility. This includes placement of additional surfacing and/or other work necessary to return an existing roadway, including shoulders, to a condition of structural or functional adequacy, for the specified service life. This might include the partial or complete removal and replacement of portions of the pavement structure (see Index 603.4).  
(42)Resurfacing. A supplemental surface layer or replacement layer placed on an existing pavement to restore its riding qualities and/or to increase its structural (load carrying) strength.  
(43)Rigid Pavement. Pavement engineered with a rigid surface course (typically Portland cement concrete or a variety of specialty cement mixes for rapid strength concretes) which may incorporate underlying layers of stabilized or unstabilized base or subbase materials. These types of pavements rely on the substantially higher stiffness of the rigid slab to distribute the vehicle loads over a relatively wide area of underlying layers and the subgrade. Some rigid slabs have reinforcing steel to help resist cracking due to temperature changes and repetitive loading.  
(44)Roadbed. The roadbed is that area between the intersection of the upper surface of the roadway and the side slopes or curb lines. The roadbed rises in elevation as each increment or layer of subbase, base or surface course is placed. Where the medians are so wide as to include areas of undisturbed land, a divided highway is considered as including two separate roadbeds.  
(45)Asphalt Rubber Binder. A blend of asphalt binder modified with crumb rubber modifier (CRM) that may include less than 15 percent CRM by mass.  
(46)Rubberized Hot Mix Asphalt (RHMA). Formerly known as rubberized asphalt concrete (RAC). RHMA is a material produced for hot mix applications by mixing either asphalt rubber or asphalt rubber binder with graded aggregate. RHMA may be gap- (RHMA-G) or open- (RHMA-O) graded.  
(47)R-value. See California R-Value.  
(48)Serviceability. The ability at time of observation of a pavement to serve vehicular traffic (automobiles and trucks) which use the facility. The primary measure of serviceability is the Present Serviceability Index (PSI), which ranges from 0 (impossible road) to 5 (perfect road).  
(49)Settlement. Localized vertical displacement of the pavement structure due to slippage or consolidation of the underlying foundation, often resulting in pavement deterioration, cracking and poor ride quality.  
(50)Structural Section. See Pavement Structure.  
(51)Structural Section Drainage System. See Pavement Drainage System.  
(52)Subbase. Unbound aggregate or granular material that is placed on the subgrade as a foundation or working platform for the base. It functions primarily as structural support, but it can also minimize the intrusion of fines from the subgrade into the pavement structure, improve drainage, and minimize frost action damage.  
(53)Subgrade. Also referred to as basement soil, it is the portion of the roadbed consisting of native or treated soil on which pavement surface course, base, subbase, or a layer of any other material is placed.  
(54) Surface Course. One or more uppermost layers of the pavement structure engineered to carry and distribute vehicle loads. The surface course typically consists of a weather- resistant flexible or rigid layer, which provides characteristics such as friction, smoothness, resistance to vehicle loads, and drainage. In addition, the surface course minimizes infiltration of surface water into the underlying base, subbase and subgrade. A surface course may be composed of a single layer with one or multiple lifts, or multiple layers of differing materials.  
(55) Tie Bars. Deformed reinforcing bars placed at intervals that hold rigid pavement slabs in adjoining lanes and exterior lane-to-shoulder joints together and prevent differential vertical and lateral movement.

# CHAPTER 80 – APPLICATION OF DESIGN STANDARDS  
## Topic 81 – Project Development Overview  
#### Index 81.1 – Philosophy  
The Project Development process seeks to provide a degree of mobility to users of the transportation system that is in balance with other values. In the development of transportation projects, social, economic, and environmental effects must be considered fully along with technical issues so that final decisions are made in the best overall public interest. Attention should be given to such considerations as:  
(a) Need to provide transportation for all users (motorists, bicyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians) of the facility and transportation modes.  
(b) Attainment of community goals and objectives.  
(c) Needs of low mobility and disadvantaged groups.  
(d) Costs and benefits of eliminating or minimizing adverse effects on natural resources, environmental values, public services, aesthetic values, and community and individual integrity.  
(e) Planning based on realistic financial estimates.  
(f) The cost, ease, and safety of maintaining whatever is built.  
Proper consideration of these items requires that a facility be viewed from the perspectives of the user, the nearby community, and larger statewide interests. For the user, efficient travel, mode selection, and safety are paramount concerns. At the same time, the community often is more concerned about local aesthetic, social, and economic impacts. The general population, however, tends to be interested in how successfully a project functions as part of the overall transportation system and how large a share of available capital resources it consumes. Therefore, individual projects must be selected for construction on the basis of overall system benefits as well as community goals, plans, and values. Decisions must also emphasize the connectivity between the different transportation modes so that they work together effectively. The goal is to increase person and goods throughput, highway mobility and safety in a manner that is compatible with, or which enhances, adjacent community values and plans.  
  
### 81.2 Highway Context  
The context of a highway is a critical factor when developing the purpose and need statement for a project in addition to making fundamental design decisions such as its typical cross section and when selecting the design elements and aesthetic features such as street furniture and construction materials. Designing a highway that is sensitive to, and respectful of, the surrounding context is critical for project success in the minds of the Department and our stakeholders. A “one-size-fits-all” design philosophy is not Departmental policy. Designers need to be aware of and sensitive to land use, community context and the associated user needs of the facility. In some instances, the design criteria and standards in this manual are based on the land use contexts in which the State highway is located, for instance: large population areas and downtowns in urban areas, small rural towns and communities, suburban commercial/residential areas, and rural corridors. This approach ensures the standards are flexible, and the approach allows and encourages methods to minimize impacts on scenic, historic, archaeological, environmental, and other important resources. Beyond their intended transportation benefits, State highways can significantly impact the civic, social and economic conditions of local communities. Designing transportation facilities that integrate the local transportation and land uses while making the design responsive to the other needs of the community support the livability of the community and are usually a complementary goal to meeting the transportation needs of the users of the State highway system. To do this successfully, the designer needs to have an understanding of the area surrounding the highway and the users of the highway, its function within the regional and State transportation systems, (which includes all transportation modes), and the level of access control needed. To gain this understanding, the designer must consult the Transportation Concept Reports and work with the planning division and the local agencies. In this manual, the following concepts are used to discuss the context of a highway:  
	• Place Type - the surrounding built and natural environment;  
	• Type of Highway - the role the highway plays in terms of providing regional or interregional connectivity and local access; and,  
	• Access Control - the degree of connection or separation between the highway and the surrounding land use.  
A “Main Street” design is not specific to a certain place type, but is a design philosophy to be applied on State highways that also function as community streets. A “Main Street” design serves pedestrians, bicyclists, businesses and public transit with motorized traffic operating at speeds of 20 to 40 miles per hour. See the Department’s “Main Street, California” document for more information.  
  
### 81.3 Place Types  
A place type describes the area’s physical environment and the land uses surrounding the State highway. The place types described below are intentionally broad. Place types should be agreed upon in partnership with all of the project stakeholders; however, there likely may be more than one place type within the limits of a project. Ultimately, the place types selected can be used to determine the appropriate application of the guidance provided in this manual. These place type definitions are independent of the Federal government definitions of urban and rural areas. See Title 23 United States Code, Section 13 for further information. Identifying the appropriate place type(s) involves discussions with the project sponsors, ideally through the Project Development Team (PDT) process, and requires coordination with the land use planning activities associated with the on-going local and regional planning activities. Extensive community engagement throughout both the project planning and project development processes helps to formulate context sensitive project alternatives and transportation facilities that coordinate with the local land uses. The following place types are used in this manual:  
	(1) Rural Areas. Rural areas are typically sparsely settled and developed. They can consist of protected federal and State lands, agricultural lands, and may include tourist and recreational destinations. However, as rural lands transition into rural communities, they can become more developed and suburban and urban-like by providing for a mixture of housing, commercial, industrial and public institutions. For the use of this manual, rural areas have been subcategorized as Natural Corridors, Developing Corridors and City/Town Centers (Rural Main Streets).  
		(a) Natural Corridors. Typically, the desire in these corridors is to preserve the natural and scenic countryside while at the same time provide transportation services to support the travel and tourism that occurs when visiting these locations. Examples of this place type are: National/State Forests and Parklands; agricultural lands with scattered farm buildings and residences; and, low density development. See Topic 109 for additional information.  
		(b) Developing Corridors. State highways traveling through these lands tend to be increasingly clustered with industrial, commercial, and residential areas as they lead into a rural city or town center. These corridors can be a transition zone among the aforementioned areas. Highways associated with these locations help to deliver tourists, but they also need to support the local communities and their local economies. In addition, these highways also serve a role and should be efficient at moving people and goods between regions. Industrial, commercial and retail buildings tend to be located separately from housing and are typically set back from the highway with parking areas placed in front. Truck traffic on these highways tends to serve the needs of these industrial, commercial and retail buildings; however, there will be a component of the truck traffic that is transporting their loads inter-regionally. Therefore, corridors in areas that are in transition may need to accommodate design vehicles.  
		(c) City or Town Centers (Rural Main Streets). State highways in this scenario are usually a conventional main street through the rural city or town, or they may be the only main street. The use of the State highway in this environment varies depending upon the individual community, as does the mix of buildings, services, businesses, and public spaces. Transit is often present and should be incorporated into the transportation system as appropriate. Transportation improvement projects on these main street highways can be more complicated and costly than similar projects in more rural settings. A balance usually needs to be maintained between the needs of the through traffic and those of the local main street environment. Thus, analyzing the pedestrian and bicyclist needs early in the development of the project and then following through on the agreements during the design of highway projects in these locations can be especially important. Accommodating the pedestrian and bicyclist needs concurrently in projects leads to greater efficiency in the use of funding.  
(2) Suburban Areas. Suburban areas lead into and can completely surround urban areas. A mixture of land uses is typical in suburban areas. This land use mixture can consist of housing, retail businesses and services, and may include regional centers such as shopping malls and other similar regional destinations; which are usually associated with suburban communities (cities and towns) that can be connected with larger urban centers and cities. Assessing the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users in concert with the vehicular needs of motorists and truck drivers is necessary during the project planning, development and design of highway projects in these locations. Accommodating all of these needs concurrently into a project leads to greater efficiency in the use of funding. For the use of this manual, suburban areas have been categorized as either Lower Density/Residential Neighborhoods or Higher Density/Regional Community Centers (Suburban Main Streets).  
	(a) Lower Density / Residential Neighborhoods. State highways typically do not cross through this place type. This place type usually feeds users onto the State highway system and is typically under the jurisdiction of a local entity. State highways, if they do interact with this place type, usually just connect at the edges of them where the pedestrians, bicyclists, and motor vehicle operators integrate into the highway system that includes transit facilities.  
	(b) Higher Density / Regional Community Centers (Suburban Main Streets). As suburban areas grow they tend to merge together into each other’s boundaries. Growth in some locations can create “Megacommunities.” While these megacommunities seem to function as individual cities, they typically have multiple distinct community centers that require highways with the capacity to serve not only each center, but the center- to-center traveler needs. These areas typically require the State highway to serve not only the originally urbanized area, but also the newer suburban areas that have been created where the housing, shopping and employment opportunities are all centered. Anticipating and accommodating growth in this place type can be a challenge. State and local governments, the business community and citizens groups, and metropolitan planning organizations all need to agree on how to meet the community needs, and at times the interregional needs of the highway.  
(3) Urban and Urbanized Areas. Urban areas generally are the major population centers in the State. Large numbers of people live in these urbanized areas where growth is expected to continue. Bicycling, transit, and walking are important transportation modes in these areas and as the facilities for pedestrians, transit and bicyclists expand in these areas, the percentage and number of travelers walking, using transit and bicycling is also likely to increase. State agencies and the local governmental entities, the business community and citizens groups, congestion management agencies and the local/regional metropolitan planning organization (MPO) need to all agree upon the concept of the transportation facilities being provided so that the community needs can be met. Urban areas are typically high-density locations such as central business districts, downtown communities, and major activity centers. They have a full range of land uses and are associated with a large diversity of activities. For the use of place types in this manual, urban areas have been categorized as Lower Density Parklands and Residential Neighborhoods and Higher Density Urban Main Streets. Higher Density Urban Main Streets have been further characterized as Community Centers and Downtown Cores.  
	(a) Lower Density Parklands and Residential Neighborhoods. Large numbers of people live in these urbanized areas and bicycling, transit and walking are important transportation modes in these areas. Parklands can enhance these neighborhoods and parkland preservation is a concern, as well as, access to support travel and tourism to the parklands.  
	(b) High Density Urban Main Streets.  
		• Community Centers or Corridor. Strategically improving the design and function of the existing State highways that cross these centers is typically a concern. Providing transportation options to enhancing these urban neighborhoods that combine highway, transit, passenger rail, walking, and biking options are desirable, while they also help promote tourism and shopping.  
		• Downtown Cores. Similar to community centers, much of the transportation system has already been built and its footprint in the community needs to be preserved while its use may need to be reallocated. Successfully meeting the mobility needs of a major metropolitan downtown core area requires a balanced approach. Such an approach is typically used to enhance the existing transportation network’s performance by adding capacity to the highways, sidewalks, and transit stations for all of the users of the system, and/or adding such enhancement features as HOV lanes, BRT, walkable corridors, etc. Right of way is limited and costly to purchase in these locations. Delivery truck traffic that supports the downtown core businesses can also create problems.  
	The HEPGIS tool on the FHWA website is available to determine if the project is in an urban area. Urban areas are found on the Highway Information tab of the tool.  
	  
### 81.4 Type of Highway  
Much of the following terminology is either already discussed in Chapter 20 or defined in Topic 62. The additional information in this portion of the manual is being provided to connect these terms with the guidance that is being provided.  
(1) Functional Classification. One of the first steps in the highway design process is to define the function that the facility is to serve. The two major considerations in functionally classifying a highway are access and throughput. Access and mobility are inversely related; as access is increased, mobility decreases. In the AASHTO “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets”, highways are functionally classified first as either urban or rural. The hierarchy of the functional highway system within either an urban or rural area consists of the following:  
	• Principal arterial - main movement (high mobility, limited access) Typically 4 lanes or more;  
	• Minor arterial - interconnects principal arterials (moderate mobility, limited access) Typically 2 or 3 lanes with turn lanes to benefit through traffic;  
	• Collectors - connects local roads to arterials (moderate mobility, moderate access) with few businesses; and,  
	• Local roads and streets - permits access to abutting land (high access, limited mobility).  
The California Road System (CRS) maps are the official functional classification maps approved by FHWA. These maps show functional classification of roads. See the link at https://caltrans.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=026e830c914c495797c969a3e5668538.  
(2) Interstate Highways. The interstate highway system was originally designed to be high- speed interregional connectors and it is a portion of the National Highway System (NHS). In urban and suburban areas, a large percentage of vehicular traffic is carried on the interstate highway system, rather than on the local arterials and streets.  
(3) State Routes. The State highway system is described in the California Streets and Highway Code, Division 1, Chapter 2 and they are further defined in this manual in Topic 62.3, Highway Types which provides definitions for freeways, expressways, and highways.  
  
### 81.5 Access Control  
Index 62.3 defines a controlled access highway and a conventional highway. The level of access control plays a part in determining the design standards that are to be utilized when designing a highway. See Index 405.6 for additional access control guidance.  
  
### 81.6 Design Standards and Highway Context  
The design standards were initially established to increase highway mobility and development, promoting a State transportation system that operated at selected levels of service consistent with projected traffic volumes and highway classification. Design standards revolved around FHWA’s controlling criteria, evolving over time to more fully consider adjacent community values, local decisions making, and area context. The design guidance and standards in this manual have been developed with the intent of ensuring that:  
	• Designers have the ability to design for all modes of travel (vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit); and,  
	• Designers have the flexibility to tailor a project to the unique circumstances that relate to it and its location, while meeting driver expectation to achieve established project goals.  
Designers should balance the interregional transportation needs with the needs of the communities they pass through. The design of projects should, when possible, expand the options for biking, walking, and transit use. In planning and designing projects, the project development team should work with locals that have any livable policies as revitalizing urban centers, building local economies, and preserving historic sites and scenic country roads. The “Main Streets: Flexibility in Planning, Design and Operations” published by the Department should be consulted for additional guidance as should the FHWA publication “Flexibility in Highway Design”. Early consultation and discussion with the Project Delivery Coordinator and the District Design Liaison during the Project Initiation Document (PID) phase is also necessary to avoid issues that may arise later in the project development process. Design Information Bulletin 78 “Design Checklist for the Development of Geometric Plans” is a tool that can be used to identify and discuss design features that may deviate from standard.  
  
## Topic 82 – Application of Standards  
### 82.1 Highway Design Manual Standards  
(1) General. The highway design criteria and policies in this manual provide a guide for the engineer to exercise sound judgment in applying standards, consistent with the above Project Development philosophy, in the design of projects. This guidance allows for flexibility in applying design standards and documenting design decisions that take the context of the project location into consideration; which enables the designer to tailor the design, as appropriate, for the specific circumstances while maintaining safety. The design standards used for any project should equal or exceed the minimum given in the Manual to the maximum extent feasible, taking into account costs (initial and life- cycle), traffic volumes, traffic and safety benefits, project goals, travel modes, facility type, right of way, socio-economic and environmental impacts, maintenance, etc. Because design standards have evolved over many years, many existing highways do not conform fully to current standards. It is not intended that current manual standards be applied retroactively to all existing State highways; such is neither warranted nor economically feasible. However, when warranted, upgrading of existing roadway features such as guardrail, lighting, superelevation, roadbed width, etc., should be considered, either as independent projects or as part of larger projects. A record of the decision not to upgrade existing non-standard design features are to be provided through the process described in Index 82.2. This manual does not address temporary construction features. It is recognized that the construction conditions encountered are so diverse and variable that it is not practical to set geometric criteria. Guidance for use of traffic control devices for temporary construction zones can be found in Part 6 – Temporary Traffic Control of the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (California MUTCD). Guidance for the engineering of pavements in temporary construction zones is available in Index 612.6. In this manual, design standards and guidance are described as follows (see Index 82.4 for other procedural requirements):  
(2) Absolute Requirements. Design guidance related to requirements of law, policy, or statute that do not allow exception are phrased by the use of “must,” “is required,” “without exception,” “are to be,” “is to be,” “in no event,” or a combination of these terms.  
(3) Controlling Criteria. The FHWA has designated the following ten controlling criteria for projects on the National Highway System (NHS) as comprehensive design standards which cover a multitude of design characteristics, allowing flexibility in application: [1]  
	• Design Speed  
	• Lane Width  
	• Shoulder Width  
	• Horizontal Curve Radius  
	• Superelevation Rate  
	• Stopping Sight Distance  
	• Maximum Grade  
	• Cross Slope  
	• Vertical Clearance  
	• Design Loading Structural Capacity (non-geometric)  
Design loading structural capacity criteria applies to all NHS facility types. See the Technical Publications – DES Manuals for further information. The remaining geometric criteria listed above are applicable to the NHS as follows: (1) On high-speed roadways (Interstate highways, other freeways, and roadways with design speeds of greater than or equal to 50 mph), all the geometric criteria apply. The stopping sight distance criteria applies to horizontal alignments and vertical alignments except for sag vertical curves; and (2) On low-speed roadways (non-freeways with design speeds less than 50 mph), only the design speed criteria applies. The two speed categories stated above that FHWA designates match the high- and low- speed definitions in Index 62.8(13) when considering that design speed and posted speed are set in 5 mph increments. The design standards related to the geometric criteria are identified in Table 82.1A among other important geometric standards in this manual regardless of the design speed of the roadway and whether or not the roadway is part of the NHS.  
(4) Standards. Design standards are those considered most essential to achievement of overall design objectives. Many pertain to requirements of law or regulations such as those embodied in the FHWA's ten controlling criteria (see Index 82.1(3)). In addition to the FHWA’s ten controlling criteria are “Caltrans-only” standards that have been identified by Caltrans as most essential pertaining to requirements of State law, policy or objectives. The design standards are shown in this manual as either Boldface type (listed in Table 82.1A) or Underlined type (listed in Table 82.1B) to indicate the approval authority for nonstandard design according to Index 82.2.  
(5) Decision Requiring Other Approvals. There are design criteria decisions that are not bold or underlined text which require specific approvals from individuals to whom such decisions have been delegated. These individuals include, but are not limited to, District Directors, Project Delivery Coordinators or their combination as specified in this manual. These decisions should be documented as the individual approving desires.  
(6) Permissive Standards. All guidance other than absolute requirements, standards, or decisions requiring other approvals, whether indicated by the use of “should”, “may”, or “can” are permissive.  
(7) Other Caltrans Publications. In addition to the design standards in this manual, see Index 82.7 for general information on the Department’s traffic engineering policy, standards, practices and study warrants. Caution must be exercised when using other Caltrans publications which provide guidelines for the design of highway facilities, such as HOV lanes. These publications do not contain design standards; moreover, the designs suggested in these publications do not always meet Highway Design Manual Standards. Therefore, all other Caltrans publications must be used in conjunction with this manual.  
(8) Transportation Facilities Under the Jurisdiction of Others. Generally, if the local road or street is a Federal-aid route it should conform to AASHTO standards; see Topic 308 – Cross Sections for Roads Under Other Jurisdictions. Occasionally though, projects on the State highway system involve work on adjacent transportation facilities that are under the jurisdiction of cities and counties. Some of these local jurisdictions may have published standards for facilities that they own and operate. The guidance in this manual may be applicable, but it was prepared for use on the State highway system. Thus, when project work impacts adjacent transportation facilities that are under the jurisdiction of cities and counties, local standards and AASHTO guidance must be used in conjunction with this manual to encourage designs that are sensitive to the local context and community values. Agreeing on which standards will be used needs to be decided early in the project delivery process and on a project by project basis.  
  
### 82.2 Approvals for Nonstandard Design  
(1) Boldface Standards. Design features or elements which deviate from standards indicated in boldface type require the approval of the Chief, Division of Design. This approval authority has been delegated to the District Directors for projects on conventional highways and expressways, and for certain other facilities in accordance with the current District Design Delegation Agreement. Approval authority for design standards indicated in boldface type on all other facilities has been delegated to the Project Delivery Coordinators except as noted in Table 82.1A where: (a) the standard has been delegated to the District Director, (b) the standards in Chapters 600 through 680 requires the approval of the State Pavement Engineer, and (c) specifically delegated to the District Director per the current District Design Delegation Agreements and may involve coordination with the Project Delivery Coordinator. See the HQ Division of Design website for the most current District Design Delegation Agreements. The current procedures and documentation requirements pertaining to the approval process for deviation from design standards indicated in boldface type as well as the dispute resolution process are contained in Chapter 21 of the Project Development Procedures Manual (PDPM). Design exception approval must be obtained pursuant to the instructions in PDPM Chapter 9. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) of 2012 allowed significant delegation to the states by FHWA to approve and administer portions of the Federal-Aid Transportation Program. MAP-21 further allowed delegation to the State DOT’s and in response to this a Stewardship and Oversight Agreement (SOA) document between FHWA and Caltrans was signed. The SOA outlines the process to determine specific project related delegation to Caltrans. In general, the SOA delegates approval of deviations from design standards related to the ten controlling criteria on all Interstate projects whether FHWA has oversight responsibilities or not to Caltrans. Exceptions to this delegation would be for projects of FHWA Division Interest, which are determined on a project by project basis. See Index 43.2 for additional information. Consultation with FHWA should be sought as early in the project development process as possible. However, formal FHWA approval, if applicable, shall not be requested until the appropriate Caltrans representative has approved the design decision document. FHWA approval is not required for deviations from "Caltrans-only" standards. Table 82.1A identifies these “Caltrans-only” standards. Where FHWA approval of a deviation from a design standard is required, only cite the standards that are identified by the FHWA as ten controlling criteria, see Index 82.1(3). For local facilities crossing the State right of way see Index 308.1.  
(2) Underlined Standards. The authority to approve deviations from standards indicated in underlined type has been delegated to the District Directors. A list of these standards is provided in Table 82.1B. Proposals for deviations from these standards can be discussed with the District Design Liaison during development of the approval documentation. The responsibility for the establishment of procedures for review, documentation, and long term retention of approved design decisions from these standards has also been delegated to the District Directors.  
(3) Decisions Requiring Other Approvals. The authority to approve specific decisions identified in the text are also listed in Table 82.1C. The form of documentation or other instructions are provided as directed by the approval authority.  
(4) Permissive Standards. A record of deviation from permissive standards and the disclosure of the engineering decisions in support of the deviation should be documented and placed in the project file. This principle of documentation also applies when following other Division of Design guidance, e.g., Design Information Bulletins and Design Memos. The form of documentation and other instructions on long term retention of these engineering decisions are to be provided as directed by the District approval authority.  
(5) Local Agencies. Cities and counties are responsible for the design decisions they make on transportation facilities they own and operate. The responsible local entity is delegated authority to exercise their engineering judgment when utilizing the applicable design guidance and standards, including those for bicycle facilities established by Caltrans pursuant to the Streets and Highways Code Sections 890.6 and 890.8 and published in this manual. For further information on this delegation and the delegation process, see the Caltrans Local Assistance Procedures Manual, Chapter 11.  
  
### 82.3 FHWA and AASHTO Standards and Policies  
The standards in this manual generally conform to the standards and policies set forth in the AASHTO publications, "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets" (2018) and "A Policy on Design Standards-Interstate System" (2016). A third AASHTO publication, the latest edition of the "Roadside Design Guide", focuses on creating safer roadsides. These three documents, along with other AASHTO and FHWA publications cited in 23 CFR Ch 1, Part 625, Appendix A, contain most of the current AASHTO policies and standards, and are approved references to be used in conjunction with this manual. AASHTO policies and standards, which are established as nationwide standards, do not always satisfy California conditions. When standards differ, the instructions in this manual govern, except when necessary for FHWA project approval (Index 108.7, Coordination with the FHWA). The use of publications and manuals that are developed by organizations other than the FHWA and AASHTO can also provide additional guidance not covered in this manual. The use of such guidance coupled with sound engineering judgment is to be exercised in collaboration with the guidance in this manual.  
  
### 82.4 Mandatory Procedural Requirements  
Required procedures and policies for which Caltrans is responsible, relating to project clearances, permits, licenses, required tests, documentation, value engineering, etc., are indicated by use of the word "must". Procedures and actions to be performed by others (subject to notification by Caltrans), or statements of fact are indicated by the word "will".  
  
### 82.5 Effective Date for Implementing Revisions to Design Standards   
Revisions to design standards will be issued with a stated effective date. It is understood that all projects will be designed to current standards unless a design decision has been approved in accordance with Index 82.2 or otherwise noted by separate Design Memorandum. On projects where the project development process has started, the following conditions on the effective date of the new or revised standards will be applied: For all projects where the PS&E has not been finalized, the new or revised design standards shall be incorporated unless this would impose a significant delay in the project schedule or a significant increase in the project engineering or construction costs. The Project Delivery Coordinator or individual delegated authority must make the final determination on whether to apply the new or previous design standards on a project-by-project basis for roadway features.  
• For all projects where the PS&E has been submitted to Headquarters Office Engineer for advertising or the project is under construction, the new or revised standards will be incorporated only if they are identified in the Change Transmittal as requiring special implementation.  
For locally-sponsored projects, the Oversight Engineer must inform the funding sponsor within 15 working days of the effective date of any changes in design standards as defined in Index 82.2.  
  
### 82.6 Design Information Bulletins and Other Caltrans Publications  
In addition to the design standards in this manual, Design Information Bulletins (DIBs) establish policies and procedures for the various design specialties of the Department that are in the Division of Design. Some DIBs may eventually become part of this manual, while others are written with the intention to remain as design guidance in the DIB format. References to DIBs are made in this manual by the “base” DIB number only and considered to be the latest version available on the Department Design website. See the Department Design website for further information concerning DIB numbering protocol and postings. Caution must be exercised when using other Caltrans publications, which provide guidelines for the design of highway facilities, such as HOV lanes. These publications do not contain design standards; moreover, the designs suggested in these publications do not always meet Highway Design Manual Standards. Therefore, all other Caltrans publications must be used in conjunction with this manual.  
  
### 82.7 Traffic Engineering  
The Division of Traffic Operations maintains engineering policy, standards, practices and study warrants to direct and guide decision-making on a broad range of design and traffic engineering features and systems, which are provided to meet the site-specific safety and mobility needs of all highway users. The infrastructure within a highway or freeway corridor, segment, intersection or interchange is not “complete” for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians unless it includes the appropriate traffic control devices; traffic safety systems; operational features or strategies; and traffic management elements and or systems. The presence or absence of these traffic elements and systems can have a profound effect on safety and operational performance. As such, they are commonly employed to remediate performance deficiencies and to optimize the overall performance of the “built” highway system. For additional information visit the Division of Traffic Operations website at http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/.

# CHAPTER 100 – BASIC DESIGN POLICIES  
## Topic 101 – Design Speed  
#### Index 101.1 – Highway Design Speed  
(1) General. Highway design speed is defined as: "a speed selected to establish specific minimum geometric design elements for a particular section of highway". These design elements include vertical and horizontal alignment, and sight distance. Other features such as widths of pavement and shoulders, horizontal clearances, etc., are generally not directly related to highway design speed. A highway carrying a higher volume of traffic may justify a higher design speed than a lower classification facility in similar topography, particularly where the savings in user operation and other costs are sufficient to offset the increased cost of right of way and construction. A lower design speed, however, should not be assumed for a secondary road where the topography is such that drivers are likely to travel at higher speeds. It is preferable that the design speed for any section of highway be a constant value. However, during the detailed design phase of a project, situations may arise in which engineering, economic, environmental, or other considerations make it impractical to provide the minimum elements for other design standards (e.g., curve radius, stopping sight distance, etc.) established by the design speed. See Topic 82 for documenting localized exceptions to features preventing the standard design speed. The cost to correct such restrictions may not be justified. Technically, this will result in a reduction in the effective design speed at the location in question. **Such technical reductions in design speed shall be discussed with and documented as required by the District approval authority or Project Delivery Coordinator depending upon the current District Design Delegation Agreement.** Where a reason for limiting speed is obvious to approaching drivers or bicyclists, these users are more apt to accept a lower operating speed than where there is no apparent reason for it.  
(2) Selection. Selecting the design speed for a highway is part of the Project Development Team process. See the Project Development Procedures Manual for additional guidance.  
	(a) Considerations--The chosen design speed, for a highway segment or project, needs to take into consideration the following:  
		• The selected design speed should be consistent with the operating speeds that are likely to be expected on a given highway facility. Drivers and bicyclists adjust their speed based on their perception of the physical limitations of the highway and its vehicular and bicycle traffic. In addition, bicycling and walking can be encouraged when bicyclists and pedestrians perceive an increase in safety due to lower vehicular speeds.  
		• In California the majority of State highway projects modify existing facilities. When modifying existing facilities, the design speed selected should reflect the observed motor vehicle speed (operating speed) or the anticipated operating speed upon completion of modifications. Generally the posted speed is a reliable indicator of operating speed although operating speeds frequently exceed posted speeds.   Speed limits and speed zones are discussed in Chapter 2 of the California MUTCD, which include references to the California Vehicle Code. For existing limited access highways and conventional highways in rural areas other than Main Streets, the selected design speed for these higher-speed facilities typically is 15 to 20 mph higher than the observed motor vehicle speed (operating speed). For existing lower-speed conventional highways in urban areas and rural highways that are Main Streets with observed or proposed operating speeds of 45 mph or less, the design speed should be selected to be consistent with the highway context which may discourage high-speed operating behavior. Select a design speed that is logical with respect to topography, operating speed (or anticipated operating speed if the corridor is being redesigned and the physical characteristics of the highway are being changed), adjacent land use, design volumes for all users, collision history, access control, and facility type. On projects where posted speeds or observational data is not available, the choice of design speed is influenced principally by whether the area is rural or urban, the character of terrain, economic considerations, environmental factors, type and anticipated volume of vehicular traffic, presence of non-motorized traffic, functional classification of the highway, existing and planned adjacent land use. A highway in level or rolling terrain justifies a higher design speed than one in mountainous terrain. As discussed under Topic 109, scenic values are also a consideration in the selection of a design speed.  
	(b) Freeways and Expressways--In addition to the considerations above, as high a design speed as feasible should be selected for use on freeways and expressways, which are higher-speed facilities.  
	(c) Conventional Highways  
		(1) State Highways. In addition to the considerations above, the existing and planned highway context in terms of area place type, land use, types of users, etc. influence the selection of the appropriate design speed and should be taken into account by the Project Development Team. Consideration should also be given to Local Agency standards and transportation plans for the facility when selecting the design speed.  
		(2) Local Streets or Roads. **Local streets or roads within the State right of way, including facilities which will be relinquished after construction (such as frontage roads), shall have minimum design speeds conforming to AASHTO standards, as per the functional classification of the facility in question.** *If the local agency having jurisdiction over the facility in question maintains design standards that exceed AASHTO standards, then the local agency standards should apply.* **Where the local facility connects to a freeway or expressway (such as ramp terminal intersections), the design speed of the local facility shall be a minimum of 35 miles per hour.** *However, the design speed should be 45 miles per hour when feasible.* Every effort should be made to avoid decreasing the design speed of a local facility through the State's right of way, and all due consideration should be given to local plans to upgrade or improve the facility in the near future.  
  
### 101.2 Highway Design Speed Standards [DS] 
**Table 101.2 shows appropriate ranges of design speeds that shall be used for the various types of facilities, place types, and conditions listed.** For additional guidance, see Index 101.1(2).

## Topic 102 – Design Capacity & Level of Service  
### 102.1 Design Capacity (Automobiles)  
Design capacity (automobiles) is the maximum volume of vehicle traffic for which a projected highway can provide a selected level of service. Design capacity varies with a number of factors, including:  
	(a) Level of service selected.  
	(b) Width of lanes.  
	(c) Number of lanes.  
	(d) Presence or absence of shoulders.  
	(e) Grades.  
	(f) Horizontal alignment.  
	(g) Operating speed.  
	(h) Lateral clearance.  
	(i) Side friction generated by parking, drive ways, intersections, and interchanges.  
	(j) Volumes of trucks, transit, recreational vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.  
	(k) Spacing and timing of traffic signals, and the required timing to accommodate pedestrian crossing  
Level of Service (LOS) is largely related to speed and density among many variables. Freeways should be designed to accommodate the design year peak hour traffic volumes and to operate at a LOS determined by District Planning and/or Traffic Operations. For a rough approximation of the number of lanes required on a multilane freeway, use the following design year peak hour traffic volumes per lane at the specified LOS:  
.```					  
           Design Year Peak Hour Vehicle Traffic Volume  
       LOS (Average Automobiles Per Lane Per Hour)  
┌─────┬───┬────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│Urban│C-E│1400-2400                                   │  
│Rural│C-D│1000-1850                                   │  
└─────┴───┴────────────────────────────────────────────┘  
.```
For conventional highways and expressways, District Planning and Traffic Operations should be consulted. Automobile traffic volumes can be adjusted for the effect of grades and the mix of automobiles, trucks, and recreational vehicles if a more refined calculation is desired. In those cases, consult the "Highway Capacity Manual", published by the Transportation Research Board  
  
### 102.2 Design Capacity and Quality of Service (Pedestrians and Bicycles)  
Sidewalks are to accommodate pedestrians at a Level of Service (LOS) equal to that of vehicles using the roadway, or better. More detailed guidance on design capacity for sidewalks is available in the “Highway Capacity Manual” (HCM), published by the Transportation Research Board. The HCM also has guidance regarding LOS for bicycle facilities for both on- and off–street applications. The LOS for on-street bicycle facilities should be equal to that of vehicles using the roadway or better. The design of off-street bicycle facilities can use the LOS methodology in the HCM when conditions justify deviations from the standards in Chapter 1000.  
  
## Topic 103 – Design Designation [1]  
### 103.1 Relation to Design  
The design designation is a simple, concise expression of the basic factors controlling the design of a given highway. Following is an example of this expression:  
ADT(2015)= 9800  
ADT(2035)= 20000  
DHV= 3000  
ESAL= 4500000  
D= 60%  
T= 12%  
V= 70mph  
TI_20= 11.0  
CLIMATEREGION= Desert  
  
The notation above is explained as follows:  
ADT(2015) -- The average daily traffic, in number of vehicles, for the construction year.  
ADT(2035) -- The average daily traffic for the future year used as a target in design.  
CLIMATE REGION -- Climate Region as defined in Topic 615. In addition to establishing design requirements for the project, this information is used by the Resident Engineer during construction to determine which clauses in the Standard Specifications apply to the project.  
DHV -- The two-way design hourly volume, vehicles.  
D -- The percentage of the DHV in the direction of heavier flow.  
ESAL -- The equivalent single axle loads forecasted for pavement engineering. See Topic 613.  
T -- The truck traffic volume expressed as a percent of the DHV (excluding recreational vehicles).  
TI20 -- Traffic Index used for pavement engineering. The number in the subscript is the pavement design life used for pavement design. See Index 613.3(5).  
V -- Design speed in miles per hour.  
  
Within a project, one design designation should be used except when:  
(a) The design hourly traffic warrants a change in the number of lanes, or  
(b) A change in conditions dictates a change in design speed.  
(c) The design daily truck traffic warrants a change in the Traffic Index.  
The design designation should be stated in project initiation documents and project reports and should appear on the typical cross section for all new, reconstructed, or rehabilitation (including Capital Preventative Maintenance) highway construction projects.  
  
### 103.2 Design Period  
Geometric design of new facilities and reconstruction projects should typically be based on estimated traffic 20 years after completion of construction. For new facilities and reconstruction projects on the Interstate System a minimum 20-year design period is required. With justification, for projects other than on the Interstate System, design periods less than 20 years may be approved by the District Director with concurrence by the Project Delivery Coordinator. For roundabout design period guidance, see Index 405.10. Safety, Resurfacing, Restoration, and Rehabilitation (RRR), and operational improvement projects should be designed on the basis of current ADT, including projects on the Interstate System. Complimentary to the design period, various components of a project (e.g., drainage facilities, structures, pavement structure, etc.) have a design life that may differ from the design period. For pavement design life requirements, see Topic 612.  
  
## Topic 104 – Control of Access  
### 104.1 General Policy  
Control of access is achieved by acquiring rights of access to the highway from abutting property owners and by permitting ingress and egress only at locations determined by the State. On freeways, direct access from private property to the highway is prohibited without exception. Abutting ownerships are served by frontage roads or streets connected to interchanges.  
  
### 104.2 Access Openings  
See Index 205.1 for the definition and criteria for location of access openings. The number of access openings on highways with access control should be held to a minimum. (Private property access openings on freeways are not allowed.) Parcels which have access to another public road or street as well as frontage on the expressway are not allowed access to the expressway. In some instances, parcels fronting only on the expressway may be given access to another public road or street by constructing suitable connections if such access can be provided at reasonable cost. With the exception of extensive highway frontages, access openings to an expressway are limited to one opening per parcel. Wherever possible, one opening should serve two or more parcels. In the case of a large highway frontage under one ownership, the cost of limiting access to one opening may be prohibitive, or the property may be divided by a natural barrier such as a stream or ridge, making it necessary to provide an additional opening. In the latter case, it may be preferable to connect the physically separated portions with a low-cost structure or road rather than permit two openings.  
  
### 104.3 Frontage Roads  
(1) General Policy.  
	(a) Purpose--Frontage roads are provided on freeways and expressways to:  
		• Control access to the through lanes, thus increasing safety for traffic.  
		• Provide access to abutting land ownerships.  
		• Provide or restore continuity of the local street or road systems.  
		• Provide for bicycle and pedestrian traffic that might otherwise need to use the freeway.  
	(b) Economic Considerations--In general, a frontage road is justified on freeways and expressways if the costs of constructing the frontage road are less than the costs of providing access by other means. Right of way considerations often are a determining factor. Thus, a frontage road would be justified if the investment in construction and extra right of way is less than either the severance damages or the costs of acquiring the affected property in its entirety. Frontage roads may be required to connect parts of a severed property or to serve a landlocked parcel resulting from right of way acquisition.  
	(c) Access Openings--Direct access to the through lanes is allowable on expressways. When the number of access openings on one side of the expressway exceeds three in 1,600 feet, a frontage road should be provided (see Index 104.2).  
(2) New Alignment. Frontage roads generally are not provided on freeways or expressways on new alignment since the abutting property owners never had legal right of access to the new facility. They may be provided, however, on the basis of considerations mentioned in (1) above.  
(3) Existing Alignment. Where a freeway or expressway is developed parallel to an existing highway or local street, all or part of the existing roadway often is retained as a frontage road. In such cases, if access to remainders of land on the side of the freeway or expressway right of way opposite the old road cannot be provided by other means, a frontage road must be constructed to serve the landlocked remainders or the remainders must be purchased outright. The decision whether to provide access or purchase should be based on considerations of cost, right of way impacts, street system continuity and similar factors (see (1) above).  
(4) Railroad Crossings. Frontage roads on one or both sides of a freeway or expressway on new alignment, owing to safety and cost considerations, frequently are terminated at the railroad right of way. When terminating a frontage road at the railroad crossing, bicycle and pedestrian traffic still needs to have reasonable access through the community. Any new railroad grade crossings and grade separations, and any relocations or alterations of existing crossings must be cleared with the railroad and approved by the PUC.  
(5) Frontage Roads Financed by Others. Frontage roads which are not a State responsibility under this policy may be built by the State upon request of a local political subdivision, a private agency, or an individual. Such a project must be covered by an agreement under which the State is reimbursed for all construction, right of way, and engineering costs involved.  
  
### 104.4 Protection of Access Rights  
For proper control of acquired access rights, fencing or other approved barriers shall be installed on all controlled access highways except as provided in Index 701.2(3)(e).  
  
### 104.5 Relation of Access Opening to a Median Opening [1]  
*Access openings should not be placed within 300 feet of a median opening unless the access opening is directly opposite the median opening.* Details on access openings are given under Index 205.1.  
  
### 104.6 Maintaining Local Community Access  
When planning and designing a new freeway or expressway, the designer needs to consider the impacts of an access controlled facility on the local community. Closing non-expressway local road connections may negatively impact access for pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians. A new facility may inadvertently sever local non-motorized access creating long out of direction travel. Designers need to coordinate with local agencies for access needs across an access controlled facility.

## Topic 105 – Pedestrian Facilities  
### 105.1 General Policy  
The California Vehicle Code Section 21949 has stated a policy for the Department to provide safe and convenient travel for pedestrians. Conventional highways can be used by pedestrians. Although the Department will work to provide safe and convenient pedestrian travel on these highways, not all of these highways will contain sidewalks and walkways. Connections between different modes of travel should be considered when designing highway facilities, as all people may become pedestrians when transferring to a transit based facility. Pedestrian use near transit facilities should be considered during the planning phase of transportation improvement projects. See DIB 82 for accessibility guidance of pedestrian facilities. See also Topics 115 and 116 for guidance regarding designing for bicycle traffic.  
  
### 105.2 Sidewalks and Walkways  
The design of sidewalks and walkways varies depending on the setting, standards, and requirements of local agencies. Sidewalks are desirable on conventional highways and on other areas of State highway right of way to serve pedestrians when warranted by sufficient population, density and development. Coordination with the local agency that the State highway passes through is needed to determine the appropriate time to provide sidewalks. Most local agencies in California have adopted varying design standards for urban and rural areas, as well as more specific requirements that are applicable to residential settings, downtowns, special districts, and other place types. These standards are typically tied to zoning requirements for land use established by local agencies. These land use decisions should take into account the ultimate need for public right of way, including the transportation needs of bicyclists and pedestrians. *The minimum width of a sidewalk should be 8 feet between a curb and a building when in urban and rural main street place types. For all other locations the minimum width of sidewalk should be 6 feet when contiguous to a curb or 5 feet when separated by a planting strip.* Sidewalk width does not include curbs. See Index 208.4 for bridge sidewalks. Using the minimum width may not be enough to satisfy the actual need if additional width is necessary to maintain an acceptable Level of Service (LOS) for pedestrians. Note that street furniture, buildings, utility poles, light fixtures and platoon generators, such as window displays and bus stops, can reduce the effective width of sidewalks and likewise the LOS of the walkway. Also, adequate width for curb ramps and driveways are other important accessibility considerations. See Index 205.3(6) and the Standard Plans for sidewalk requirements at driveways. See Index 208.6 for information on pedestrian overcrossings and undercrossings and Index 208.4 for sidewalks on bridges. “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets”, issued by AASHTO, and the “Highway Capacity Manual”, published by the Transportation Research Board contain pedestrian LOS criteria. These are means of measuring the ability of the existing pedestrian facilities to provide pedestrian mobility and to determine the need for improvements or expansions. If adequate capacity is not provided, pedestrian mobility may be seriously impeded. Traffic volume-pedestrian warrants for sidewalks or other types of walkways along highways have not been established. In general, whenever the roadside and land development conditions are such that pedestrians regularly move along a highway, those pedestrians should be furnished with a sidewalk or other walkway, as is suitable to the conditions. Sidewalks are typically within public right of way of the local agency or the State. When within the State highway right of way, the need for sidewalks becomes a shared interest, since the zoning, planned development, and growth are under the local agency’s purview. The State may assume financial responsibility for the construction of sidewalks and walkways under the conditions described below. See the Project Development Procedures Manual for further discussion of the State's responsibility in providing pedestrian facilities.  
(1) Replacement in Kind. Where existing sidewalks are to be disturbed by highway construction, the replacement applies only to the frontages involved and no other sidewalk construction is authorized except:  
	(a) As part of a right of way agreement.  
	(b) Where the safety or capacity of the highway will be improved.  
(2) Conventional Highways. The roadway cross section usually provides areas for pedestrians. If the safety or capacity of the highway will be improved, the State may contribute towards the cost of building a pedestrian facility with a local agency project or fund it entirely with a State highway project. The city, county, or property owner whose adjacent development generated the pedestrian traffic may build sidewalks on State right of way under a permit in accordance with the route concept report.  
(3) Freeway and other Controlled Access Facilities. Sidewalks should be built across the freeway right of way on overcrossings and through undercrossings where necessary to connect with existing or planned sidewalks. Construction of planned sidewalks should be imminent. Within the foregoing criteria, sidewalks can be part of the original project or added later when the surrounding area develops.  
(4) Overcrossing and Undercrossing Approaches. Where sidewalks are planned on overcrossing structures or under a structure, an area should be provided to accommodate future sidewalks.  
(5) School Pedestrian Walkways. School pedestrian walkways may be identified along a route used by school pedestrians that is not limited to crossing locations, but includes where physical conditions require students to walk in or along rural or suburban roadways.  
(6) Frontage Roads. Sidewalks may be built along frontage roads connecting local streets that would otherwise dead end at the freeways. Such sidewalks can be new or replacements of existing facilities. Sidewalks may not be needed on the freeway side of frontage roads except where connections must be made to pedestrian separations or other connections where appropriate.  
(7) Separated Cross Streets. Sidewalks may be built on separated cross streets where reconstruction of the cross street is made necessary by the freeway project and where the criteria of paragraph (3) above apply.  
(8) Transit Stops. Sidewalks should be built to connect transit stops to local streets.  
(9) Vehicular Tunnels. Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities may be built as part of vehicular tunnels which do not require ventilation as part of the tunnel structure. Contact the Division of Engineering Services - Structure Design (DES-SD), regarding allowable conditions.  
(10) Maintenance. The State is responsible for maintaining and replacing damaged sidewalks within the right of way except:  
	(a) Where the sidewalk was placed by a private party under encroachment permit that requires the permittee to maintain the sidewalk, but only if the original permittee still owns the abutting property.  
	(b) Where the city or county has placed nonstandard sidewalks with colored or textured surfaces, or meandering alignment. See Maintenance Manual for additional discussion on State's maintenance responsibilities regarding sidewalks.  
  
### 105.3 Pedestrian Grade Separations  
(1) Pedestrian grade separation takes the form of pedestrian overcrossings or undercrossings. These grade separations are suitable for crossing freeways, rivers, railroads, canyons and other obstacles for which no other crossing opportunities exist. See Index 208.6 for design guidance for pedestrian and bicycle overcrossings and undercrossings. The need for a pedestrian grade separation is based on a study of the present and future needs of a particular area or community. Each situation should be investigated and considered on its own merits. The study should cover pedestrian generating sources in the area, pedestrian crossing volumes, type of highway to be crossed, location of adjacent crossing facilities, circuity, zoning, land use, sociological and cultural factors, and the predominant age of persons expected to utilize the facility. Pedestrian patterns should be maintained across freeway routes where these patterns have been previously established. Where vehicular crossings are inadequate for pedestrians, separate structures should be provided. In general, if a circuitous route is involved, a pedestrian separation may be justified even though the number of pedestrians is small. State participation in the financing of pedestrian separations at ramp terminals is not normally justified because of the crash history at these locations. Exceptions to this general policy should be considered only in special circumstances where no less expensive alternative is feasible. Where a pedestrian grade separation is justified, an overcrossing is preferred. Undercrossings tend to provide less visibility which provides more opportunities for vandalism and criminal activity. Consideration may be given to an undercrossing when specifically requested in writing by a local agency. Unobstructed visibility should be provided through the structure and approaches. See Index 105.4 for discussion of provisions for persons with disabilities.  
(2) Financing.  
	(a) Freeways--Where the pedestrian grade separation is justified prior to award of the freeway contract, the State should pay the full cost of the pedestrian facility. In some cases, construction of the separation may be deferred; however, where the need has been established to the satisfaction of the Department prior to award of the freeway contract, the State should pay the entire cost of the separation. Local jurisdictions have control (by zoning and planning) of development that influences pedestrian traffic patterns. Therefore, where a pedestrian grade separation is justified after the award of a freeway contract, the State's share of the total construction cost of the separation should not exceed 50 percent. The State must enter into a cooperative agreement with the local jurisdiction on this basis.  
	(b) Conventional Highways--Grade separations are not normally provided for either cars or pedestrians on conventional highways. However, in those rare cases where pedestrian use is extensive, where it has been determined that placement and configuration of the grade separation will result in the majority of pedestrians using it, and where the local agency has requested in writing that a pedestrian separation be constructed, an overcrossing may be considered. The State's share of the total construction cost of the pedestrian facility should not exceed 50 percent. The State must enter into a cooperative agreement with the local jurisdiction on this basis.  
  
### 105.4 Accessibility Requirements  
(1) Background. The requirement to provide equivalent access to facilities for all individuals, regardless of  disability, is stated in several laws adopted at both the State and Federal level. Two of  the most notable references are The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) which  was enacted by the Federal Government and took effect on January 26, 1992, and  Section 4450 of the California Government Code.  
	(a) Americans with Disabilities Act Highlights.  
		• Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by state and  local governments (public entities). This means that a public entity may not deny  the benefits of its programs, activities and services to individuals with disabilities  because its facilities are inaccessible. A public entity’s services, programs, or  activities, when viewed in their entirety, must be readily accessible to and usable  by individuals with disabilities. This standard, known as “program accessibility,”  applies to all existing facilities of a public entity.  
		• Public entities are not necessarily required to make each of their existing facilities  accessible. Public entities may achieve program accessibility by a number of  methods (e.g., providing transit as opposed to structurally accessible pedestrian  facilities). However, in many situations, providing access to facilities through  structural methods, such as alteration of existing facilities and acquisition or  construction of additional facilities, may be the most efficient method of providing  program accessibility.  
		• Where structural modifications are required to achieve program accessibility, a  public entity with 50 or more employees is required to develop a transition plan  setting forth the steps necessary to complete such modifications.  
		• In compliance with the ADA, Title 28 of the Code of Federal regulations (CFR) Part  35 identifies all public entities to be subject to the requirements for ADA regardless  of funding source. It further states that the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards  (UFAS) and the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for  Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) are acceptable design guidelines that may be  used. However, FHWA has directed Caltrans to use the ADAAG as the Federal  design guidelines for pedestrian accessibility.  
	(b) California Government Code 4450 et seq. Highlights.  
		• Sections 4450 (through 4461) of the California Government Code require that  buildings, structures, sidewalks, curbs, and related facilities that are constructed  using any State funds, or the funds of cities, counties, or other political subdivisions  be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.   
(2) Policy. It is Caltrans policy to:  
		• Comply with the ADA and the Government Code 4450 et seq. by making all State  highway facilities accessible to people with disabilities to the maximum extent  feasible. In general, if a project on State right of way is providing a pedestrian  facility, then accessibility must be addressed.  
(3) Procedures.   
	(a) The engineer will consider pedestrian accessibility needs in the project initiation  documents for all projects where applicable.  
	(b) All State highway projects administered by Caltrans or others with pedestrian facilities must be designed in accordance with the requirements in Design Information Bulletin 82, “Pedestrian Accessibility Guidelines for Highway Projects.”  
	(c) The details of the pedestrian facilities and their relationship to the project as a whole  should be discussed with the District Design Liaison for the application of DIB 82, the  guidance of this manual, as well as other required design guidance. ADA compliance must be recorded on the Ready-to-List certification for Stateadministered projects. Appropriate project records should document the fact that  necessary review and approvals have been obtained as required above. In addition to the above mentioned Design procedures, the Districts and Regions have  established procedures for certifying that the project “as-built” complies with the ADA  standards in DIB 82 before a project can achieve Construction Contract Acceptance  (CCA) or before the Notice of Completion is provided for a permit project.  
  
### 105.5 Guidelines for the Location and Design of Curb Ramps   
(1) Policy. On all State highway projects adequate and reasonable access for the safe and convenient movement of persons with disabilities are to be provided across curbs that are constructed or replaced at pedestrian crosswalks. This includes all marked and unmarked crosswalks, as defined in Section 275 of the Vehicle Code. Access should also be provided at bridge sidewalk approaches and at curbs in the vicinity of pedestrian separation structures. Where a need is identified at an existing curb on a conventional highway, a curb ramp may be constructed either by others under encroachment permit or by the State.  
(2) Location Guidelines. When locating curb ramps, designers must consider the position of utilities such as power poles, fire hydrants, street lights, traffic signals, and drainage facilities. *When curb ramps are constructed or reconstructed, one curb ramp should be provided for each pedestrian street crossing. A blended transition that spans the curb return across both pedestrian crossings serves the purpose of two curb ramps.* For example, at intersection corners where two pedestrian street crossings are located, two curb ramps should be constructed; if only one pedestrian street crossing is located at a corner, one curb ramp may be constructed. See Index 105.6 for further information. The usage of the one-ramp design should be restricted to those locations where the volume of pedestrians and vehicles making right turns is low. This will reduce the potential frequency of conflicts between turning vehicles and persons with disabilities entering the common crosswalk area to cross either street. Ramps and/or curb openings should be provided at midblock crosswalks and where pedestrians cross curbed channelization or median islands at intersections. Often, on traffic signalization, channelization, and similar projects, curbs are proposed to be modified only on portions of an existing intersection. In those cases, consideration should be given to installing retrofit curb ramps on all legs of the intersection.  
(3) Ramp Design. Curb ramp designs should conform to current Standard Plans. See Index 105.4(3) for review procedures.  
  
### 105.6 Pedestrian Crossings  
There are various standards related to pedestrian crossings in this manual (e.g., the two curb ramps at each corner and pedestrian refuge island standards), as well as in DIB 82 (e.g., the curb ramp requirement) that depend on the existence of a pedestrian crossing as prescribed in the California Vehicle Code (CVC). Pedestrian facilities that support pedestrian crossings occur at marked and unmarked crosswalks. Per the CA MUTCD, a marked crosswalk is striped, including at midblock locations. An unmarked crosswalk is not striped and, per the CVC, depends on two elements: 1) it occurs at an intersection, and 2) it occurs where the sidewalk connects to the intersection. Without these two elements, there is no unmarked crosswalk. Per the CVC, pedestrian crossings are provided across highways as marked or unmarked crosswalks, thereby requiring vehicles to yield to pedestrians (CVC 21950). Two examples in Figure 105.6 clarify the existence of unmarked crosswalks at “T” intersections, but may also apply to four legged intersections. This example is based on the following CVC citations:  
	• Section 275 - For the definition of crosswalk, see Index 62.4(5). Section 275 describes marked and unmarked crosswalks.  
	• Section 360 - A highway is a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. Highway includes street.  
	• Section 365 - An “intersection” is the area embraced within the prolongations of the lateral curb lines, or, if none, then the lateral boundary lines of the roadways, of two highways which join one another at approximately right angles or the area within which vehicles traveling upon different highways joining at any other angle may come in conflict.  
	• Section 530 - A “roadway” is that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.  
	• Section 555 - A “sidewalk” is that portion of a highway, other than the roadway, set apart by curbs, barriers, markings or other delineation for pedestrian travel.

## Topic 115 – Designing for Bicycle Traffic  
### 115.1 General  
Under the California Vehicle Code, bicyclists generally have the same rights and duties that motor vehicle drivers do when using the State highway system. For example, they make the same merging and turning movements, they need adequate sight distance, they need access to all destinations, etc. Therefore, designing for bicycle traffic and designing for motor vehicle traffic are similar and based on the same fundamental transportation engineering principles. The main differences between bicycle and motor vehicle operations are lower speed and acceleration capabilities, as well as greater sensitivity to out of direction travel and steep uphill grades. Design guidance that addresses the safety and mobility needs of bicyclists on Class II bikeways (bike lanes) is distributed throughout this manual. See Chapter 1000 for additional bicycle guidance for Class I bikeways (bike paths) and Class III bikeways (bike routes). See Design Information Bulletin (DIB) 89 for Class IV bikeways (separated bikeways) guidance. All city, county, regional and other local agencies responsible for bikeways or roads except those freeway segments where bicycle travel is prohibited shall follow the bikeway design criteria established in this manual and the California MUTCD, as authorized in the Streets and Highways Code Sections 890.6 and 891(a). However, a local agency may utilize alternative design criteria as prescribed in the Streets and Highways Code Section 891(b). The decision to develop bikeways should be made in consultation and coordination with local agencies responsible for bikeway planning to ensure connectivity and network development. Generally speaking, bicycle travel can be enhanced by bikeways or improvements to the right-hand portion of roadways, where bicycles are required to travel. When feasible, a wider shoulder than minimum standard should be considered since bicyclists are required to ride to as far to the right as possible, and shoulders provide bicyclists an opportunity to pull over to let faster traffic pass. All transportation improvements are an opportunity to improve safety, access, and mobility for the bicycle mode of travel.   
  
## Topic 116 – Bicyclists and Pedestrians on  Freeways  
### 116.1 General  
Seldom is a freeway shoulder open to bicycle, pedestrian or other non-motorized travel, but they can be opened for use if certain criteria assessing the safety and convenience of the freeway, as compared with available alternate routes, is met. However, a freeway should not be opened to bicycle or pedestrian use if it is determined to be incompatible. The District Traffic Engineer or designee and the Project Delivery Coordinator must approve any proposals to open freeways to bicyclists, pedestrian or other non-motorized use. See the California MUTCD and CVC Section 21960. When a new freeway segment is to remain open or existing freeway segment is to be reopened to these modes, it is necessary to evaluate the freeway features for their compatibility with safe and efficient travel, including:  
	• Shoulder widths  
	• Drainage grates; see Index 1003.5(2)  
	• Expansion joints  
	• Utility access covers on shoulders  
	• Frequency and spacing of entrance/exit ramps  
	• Multiple-lane entrance/exit ramps  
	• Traffic volumes on entrance/exit ramps and on lanes merging into exit ramps  
	• Sight distance at entrance/exit ramps  
	• Freeway to freeway interchanges  
	• The presence and design of rumble strips  
	• Longitudinal edges and joints  
If a freeway segment has no suitable non-freeway alternative and is closed because certain features are considered incompatible, the feasibility of eliminating or reducing the incompatible features should be evaluated. This evaluation may include removal, redesign, replacement, relocation or retrofitting of the incompatible feature, or installation of signing, pavement markings, or other traffic control devices. Where no reasonable, convenient and safe non-freeway alternative exists within a freeway corridor, the Department should coordinate with local agencies to develop new routes, improve existing routes or provide parallel bicycle and pedestrian facilities within or adjacent to the freeway right of way. See Project Development Procedures Manual Chapter 1, Article 3 (Regional and System Planning) and Chapter 31 (Nonmotorized Transportation Facilities) for discussion of the development of non-freeway transportation alternatives.   
  
# CHAPTER 200 – GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND  STRUCTURE STANDARDS  
### Topic 201 – Sight Distance  
#### Index 201.1 – General  
Sight distance is the continuous length of highway ahead, visible to the highway user. Four types of sight distance are considered herein: passing, stopping, decision, and corner. Passing sight distance is used where use of an opposing lane can provide passing opportunities (see Index 201.2). Stopping sight distance is the minimum sight distance for a given design speed to be provided on multilane highways and on 2-lane roads when passing sight distance is not economically obtainable. Stopping sight distance also is to be provided for all users, including motorists and bicyclists, at all elements of interchanges and intersections at grade, including private road connections (see Topic 504, Index 405.1, & Figure 405.7). Decision sight distance is used at major decision points (see Indexes 201.7 and 504.2). Corner sight distance is used at intersections (see Index 405.1, Figure 405.7, and Figure 504.3I). **Table 201.1 shows the minimum standards for stopping sight distance related to design speed for motorists.** Stopping sight distances given in the table are suitable for Class II and Class III bikeways. The stopping sight distances are also applicable to roundabout design on the approach roadway, within the circulatory roadway, and on the exits prior to the pedestrian crossings. Also shown in Table 201.1 are the values for use in providing passing sight distance. See Chapter 1000 for Class I bikeway sight distance guidance. Chapter 3 of "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," AASHTO, contains a thorough discussion of the derivation of stopping sight distance.  
  
### 201.2 Passing Sight Distance  
Passing sight distance is the minimum sight distance required for the driver of one vehicle to pass another vehicle safely and comfortably. Passing must be accomplished assuming an oncoming vehicle comes into view and maintains the design speed, without reduction, after the overtaking maneuver is started.

.```
(1)See Topic 101 for selection of design speed.  
(2)For sustained downgrades, refer to underlined standard in Index 201.3  
  
The sight distance available for passing at any place is the longest distance at which a driver whose eyes are 3½ feet above the pavement surface can see the top of an object 4¼ feet high on the road. See Table 201.1 for the calculated values that are associated with various design speeds. In general, 2-lane highways should be designed to provide for passing where possible, especially those routes with high volumes of trucks or recreational vehicles. Passing should be done on tangent horizontal alignments with constant grades or a slight sag vertical curve. Not only are drivers reluctant to pass on a long crest vertical curve, but it is impracticable to design crest vertical curves to provide for passing sight distance because of high cost where crest cuts are involved. Passing sight distance for crest vertical curves is 7 to 17 times longer than the stopping sight distance. Ordinarily, passing sight distance is provided at locations where combinations of alignment and profile do not require the use of crest vertical curves. Passing sight distance is considered only on 2-lane roads. At critical locations, a stretch of 3- or 4-lane passing section with stopping sight distance is sometimes more economical than two lanes with passing sight distance. Passing on sag vertical curves can be accomplished both day and night because headlights can be seen through the entire curve. See Part 3 of the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (California MUTCD) for criteria relating to the placement of barrier striping for no-passing zones. Note, that the passing sight distances shown in the California MUTCD are based on traffic operational criteria. Traffic operational criteria are different from the design characteristics used to develop the values provided in Table 201.1 and Chapter 3 of AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. The aforementioned table and AASHTO reference are also used to design the vertical profile and horizontal alignment of the highway. Consult the District Traffic Engineer or designee when using the California MUTCD criteria for traffic operating-control needs. Other means for providing passing opportunities, such as climbing lanes or turnouts, are discussed in Index 204.5. Chapter 3 of AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, contains a thorough discussion of the derivation of passing sight distance.  
  
### 201.3 Stopping Sight Distance [SSD]
The minimum stopping sight distance is the distance required by the user, traveling at a  given speed, to bring the vehicle or bicycle to a stop after an object ½-foot high on the  road becomes visible. Stopping sight distance for motorists is measured from the driver's  eyes, which are assumed to be 3 ½ feet above the pavement surface, to an object ½-foot  high on the road. See Index 1003.1(10) for Class I bikeway stopping sight distance  guidance. *The stopping sight distances in Table 201.1 should be increased by 20 percent on  sustained downgrades steeper than 3 percent and longer than one mile.*  
  
### 201.4 Stopping Sight Distance at Grade Crests [SSDC]
Figure 201.4 shows graphically the relationships between length of highway crest vertical  curve, design speed, and algebraic difference in grades. Any one factor can be  determined when the other two are known.  
  
### 201.5 Stopping Sight Distance at Grade Sags [SSDS] 
From the curves in Figure 201.5, the minimum length of vertical curve which provides  headlight sight distance in grade sags for a given design speed can be obtained. If headlight sight distance is not obtainable at grade sags, lighting may be considered.  The District approval authority or Project Delivery Coordinator, depending upon the current  District Design Delegation Agreement, and the District Traffic Engineer or designee shall  be contacted to review proposed grade sag lighting to determine if such use is appropriate.  
  
### 201.6 Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves [SSDHC] 
Where an object off the pavement such as a bridge pier, building, cut slope, or natural growth restricts sight distance, the minimum radius of curvature is determined by the stopping sight distance. Available stopping sight distance on horizontal curves is obtained from Figure 201.6. It is assumed that the driver's eye is 3 ½ feet above the center of the inside lane (inside with respect to curve) and the object is ½-foot high. The line of sight is assumed to intercept the view obstruction at the midpoint of the sight line and 2 feet above the center of the inside lane when the road profile is flat (i.e. no vertical curve). Crest vertical curves can cause additional reductions in sight distance. The clear distance (m) is measured from the center of the inside lane to the obstruction. The design objective is to determine the required clear distance from centerline of inside lane to a retaining wall, bridge pier, abutment, cut slope, or other obstruction for a given design speed. Using radius of curvature and minimum sight distance for that design speed, Figure 201.6 gives the clear distance (m) from centerline of inside lane to the obstruction. See Index 1003.1(13) for bikeway stopping sight distance on horizontal curve guidance. When the radius of curvature and the clear distance to a fixed obstruction are known, Figure 201.6 also gives the sight distance for these conditions. See Index 101.1 for technical reductions in design speed caused by partial or momentary horizontal sight distance restrictions. See Index 203.2 for additional comments on glare screens. Cuts may be widened where vegetation restricting horizontal sight distance is expected to grow on finished slopes. Widening is an economic trade-off that must be evaluated along with other options. See Topic 902 for sight distance requirements on landscape projects.  
  
### 201.7 Decision Sight Distance [DSD] 
At certain locations, sight distance greater than stopping sight distance is desirable to allow drivers time for decisions without making last minute erratic maneuvers (see Chapter III of AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, for a thorough discussion of the derivation of decision sight distance.) *On freeways and expressways the decision sight distance values in Table 201.7 should be used at lane drops and at off-ramp noses to interchanges, branch connections, safety roadside rest areas, vista points, and inspection stations.* When determining decision sight distance on horizontal and vertical curves, Figures 201.4, 201.5, and 201.6 can be used. Figure 201.7 is an expanded version of Figure 201.4 and gives the relationship among length of crest vertical curve, design speed, and algebraic difference in grades for much longer vertical curves than Figure 201.4. Decision sight distance is measured using the 3½-foot eye height and ½-foot object height. See Index 504.2 for sight distance at secondary exits on a collector-distributor road.  
  
## Topic 202 – Superelevation  
### 202.1 Basic Criteria  
When a vehicle moves in a circular path, it undergoes a centripetal acceleration that acts toward the center of curvature. This force is countered by the perceived centrifugal force experienced by the motorist. On a superelevated highway, this force is resisted by the vehicle weight component parallel to the superelevated surface and by the side friction developed between the tires and pavement. It is impractical to balance centrifugal force by superelevation alone, because for any given curve radius a certain superelevation rate is exactly correct for only one driving speed. At all other speeds there will be a side thrust either outward or inward, relative to the curve center, which must be offset by side friction. If the vehicle is not skidding, these forces are in equilibrium as represented by the following simplified curve equation, which is used to design a curve for a comfortable operation at a particular speed:

Standard superelevation rates are designed to hold the portion of the centrifugal force that must be taken up by tire friction within allowable limits. Friction factors as related to speed are shown on Figure 202.2. The factors apply equally to flexible and rigid pavements.  
  
### 202.2 Standards for Superelevation [SE] 
(1) Highways. Maximum superelevation rates for various highway conditions are shown in Tables 202.2A through 202.2E. The maximum rates of superelevation (emax) used on highways are controlled by four factors: climate conditions (i.e., frequency and amount of snow and ice); terrain conditions (i.e., flat, rolling, or mountainous); type of area (i.e., rural or urban); and frequency of slow-moving vehicles whose operations might be affected by high superelevation rates. Consideration of these factors jointly leads to the conclusion that no single maximum superelevation rate is universally applicable. The highest superelevation rate for highways in common use is 10 percent, although 12 percent is used in some cases. Superelevation rates above 8 percent are only used in areas without snow and ice. Although higher superelevation rates offer an advantage to vehicles at high speeds, current practice considers that rates in excess of 12 percent are beyond practical limits. This practice recognizes the combined effects of construction processes, maintenance difficulties, and operation of vehicles at low speeds. Where traffic congestion or the clustered land use of developing corridors (i.e., industrial, commercial, and residential) restricts top speeds, it is common practice to utilize a lower maximum rate of superelevation (typically 4 to 6 percent). Similarly, either a low maximum rate of superelevation or no superelevation is employed within intersection areas or where there is a tendency to drive slowly because of turning and crossing movements, warning devices, and signals. In these areas it is difficult to warp crossing pavements for drainage without providing negative superelevation for some turning movements. Therefore, use of Tables 202.2D and 202.2E for urban roads may not apply in these locations. **Roadways described below, (a) through (e), shall be designed with the emax indicated.** Design of local roads should generally use (d) and (e).  
	(a) Use emax=12% for ramps, connectors, 2-lane conventional highways, and frontage roads. See Index 202.7 for frontage roads under other jurisdictions.  
	(b) Use emax=10% for freeways, expressways, and multilane conventional highways.  
	(c) Use emax=8% when snow and ice conditions prevail (usually over 3,000 feet elevation).  
	(d) Use emax=6% for urban roads with design speeds 35 to 45 miles per hour.  
	(e) Use emax=4% for urban roads with design speeds less than 35 miles per hour.  
**Based on the above emax, superelevation rates from Tables 202.2A through 202.2E shall be used with the minimum curve radii and design speed (Vd).** If the superelevation rate is not a whole number, the superelevation rate may be rounded up to the next whole number. **If less than standard superelevation rates are approved (see Index 82.1), Figure 202.2 shall be used to determine superelevation based on the curve radius and maximum comfortable speed.** When using Tables 202.2A through 202.2E for a given radius, interpolation is not necessary as the superelevation rate should be determined from a radius equal to, or slightly smaller than, the radius provided in the table. The result is a superelevation rate that is rounded up to the nearest 0.2 of a percent. For example, a 50 mph curve with a maximum superelevation rate of 8 percent and a radius of 1,880 feet should use the radius of 1,830 feet to obtain a superelevation of 5.4 percent. Also, Tables 202.2A through 202.2E use the following terms as defined:  
	(1) “normal crown” (NC) designates a traveled way cross section used on curves that are so flat that the elimination of adverse cross slope is not needed, and thus the normal cross slope sections can be used. See Index 301.3 for further guidance.  
	(2) “remove adverse crown” (RC) designates curves where the adverse cross slope should be eliminated by superelevating the entire roadway at the normal cross slope rate.  
Maximum comfortable speed is determined by the formula given on Figure 202.2. It represents the speed on a curve where discomfort caused by centripetal acceleration is evident to a driver. AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, states, "In general, studies show that the maximum side friction factors developed between new tires and wet concrete pavements range from about 0.5 at 20 miles per hour to approximately 0.35 at 60 miles per hour. In all cases, the studies show a decrease in friction values as speeds increase." To use Figure 202.2, the designer must decide on the relative importance among three variables. Normally, when a nonstandard superelevation rate is approved, Figure 202.2 will be entered with the superelevation rate and a desired curve radius. It must then be determined whether the resulting maximum comfortable speed is adequate for the conditions or whether further adjustments to radius and superelevation may be needed. Except for short radius curves, the standard superelevation rate results in very little side thrust at speeds less than 45 miles per hour. This provides maximum comfort for most drivers. Superelevation for horizontal curves with radii of 10,000 feet and greater may be deleted in those situations where the combination of a flat grade and a superelevation transition would create undesirable drainage conditions on the pavement. Superelevated cross slopes on curves extend the full width of the traveled way and shoulders, except that the shoulder slope on the low side should be not less than the minimum shoulder slope used on the tangents (see Index 304.3 for cross slopes undercut widening conditions). *On rural 2-lane roads, superelevation should be on the same plane for the full width of traveled way and shoulders, except on transitions (see Index 304.3 for cut widening conditions).*  
(2) Bikeways. Superelevation design criteria in Index 202.2(1) also accommodates Class II, III, and IV bikeways. See Index 1003.1 for Class I guidance.  
  
### 202.3 Restrictive Conditions  
Lower superelevation rates than those given in either Table 202.2 or Figure 202.2 may be necessary in areas where restricted speed zones or ramp/street intersections are controlling factors. Other typical locations are short radius curves on ramps near the local road juncture, either at an intersection or where a loop connects with an overcrossing structure. Often, established street grades, curbs, or drainage may prove difficult to alter and/or superelevation transition lengths would be undesirably short. Such conditions may justify a reduction in the superelevation rate, different rates for each half of the roadbed, or both. In any case, the superelevation rate provided should be appropriate for the conditions allowing for a smooth transition while providing the maximum level of comfort to the driver. Where standard superelevation rates cannot be attained, discussions should be held with the District Design Liaison and/or the Project Delivery Coordinator to determine the proper solution and the necessity of preparing a design standard decision document. In warping street or ramp surface areas for drainage, adverse superelevation should be avoided (see Figure 202.2).  
  
### 202.4 Axis of Rotation  
(1) Undivided Highways. For undivided highways the axis of rotation for superelevation is usually the centerline of the roadbed. However, in special cases such as desert roads where curves are preceded by long relatively level tangents, the plane of superelevation may be rotated about the inside edge of traveled way to improve perception of the curve. in flat country, drainage pockets caused by superelevation may be avoided by changing the axis of rotation from the centerline to the inside edge of traveled way.  
(2) Ramps and Freeway-to-freeway Connections. The axis of rotation may be about either edge of traveled way or centerline if multilane. Appearance and drainage considerations should always be taken into account in selection of the axis of rotation.  
(3) Divided Highways.  
	(a) Freeways – Where the initial median width is 65 feet or less, the axis of rotation should be at the centerline. Where the initial median width is greater than 65 feet and the ultimate median width is 65 feet or less, the axis of rotation should be at the centerline, except where the resulting initial median slope would be steeper than 10:1. In the latter case, the axis of rotation should be at the ultimate median edges of traveled way. Where the ultimate median width is greater than 65 feet, the axis of rotation should normally be at the ultimate median edges of traveled way. To avoid sawtooth on bridges with decked medians, the axis of rotation, if not already on centerline, should be shifted to the centerline.

todo!() do something with Figure 202.2  
  
  
	(b) Conventional Highways – The axis of rotation should be considered on an individual project basis and the most appropriate case for the conditions should be selected. Aesthetics, grade distortion, superelevation transitions, drainage, and driver perception should be considered when selecting the axis of rotation (see Index 204.2)  
  
### 202.5 Superelevation Transition  
(1) General. The superelevation transition generally consists of the crown runoff and the superelevation runoff as shown on Figure 202.5A and 202.5B. A superelevation transition should be designed in accordance with the diagram and tabular data shown in Figure 202.5A to satisfy the requirements of safety, comfort and pleasing appearance. The length of superelevation transition should be based upon the combination of superelevation rate and width of rotated plane in accordance with the tabulated superelevation runoff lengths on the bottom of Figure 202.5A. Edge of traveled way and shoulder profiles should be plotted and irregularities resulting from interactions between the superelevation transition and vertical alignment of the roadway should be eliminated by introducing smooth curves. Edge of traveled way and shoulder profiles also will reveal flat areas which are undesirable from a drainage standpoint and should be avoided.  
(2) Runoff. Two-thirds of the superelevation runoff should be on the tangent and one-third within the curve. This results in two-thirds of the full superelevation rate at the beginning or ending of a curve. This may be altered as required to adjust for flat spots or unsightly sags and humps, or when conforming to existing roadway.  
(3) Restrictive Situations. In restrictive situations, such as on two lane highways in mountainous terrain, interchange ramps, collector roads, frontage roads, etc., where curve radius and length and tangents between curves are short, standard superelevation rates and/or transitions may not be attainable. In such situations the highest possible superelevation rate(s) and transition length should be used, but the rate of change of cross slope should not exceed 6 percent per 100 feet.  
(4) Superelevation Transitions on Bridges. Superelevation transitions on bridges should be avoided whenever possible (See Index 203.9).  
(5) Shoulder Transitions. The shoulder plane rotates about the adjacent edge of traveled way as well as the rotational axis of the traveled way. Shoulder superelevation transitions should be smooth and compatible with the transition of the adjacent pavements

### 202.6 Superelevation of Compound Curves  
*Superelevation of compound curves should follow the procedure as shown in Figure 202.6.  Where feasible, the criteria in Index 202.5 should apply.*  
  
### 202.7 Superelevation on City Streets and County Roads  
**Superelevation rates of local streets and roads which are within the State right of way (with or without connection to State facilities) shall conform to AASHTO standards, for the functional classification of the facility in question.** *If the local agency having jurisdiction over the local facility in question maintains standards that exceed AASHTO standards, then the local agency standards should prevail.* See Index 202.2 for Frontage Roads within the State right of way. Frontage roads that will be relinquished after construction should follow AASHTO or local standards as stated above.  
  
## Topic 203 – Horizontal Alignment  
### 203.1 General Controls  
Horizontal alignment should provide for safe and continuous operation at a uniform design speed for substantial lengths of highway. The standards which follow apply to curvature on both 2-lane and multilane highways except when otherwise noted. These standards also apply to portions of local streets and roads within the State right of way which connect directly to a freeway or expressway, or are expected to do so in the foreseeable future. **For local facilities which are within the State right of way and where there is no connection or the connection is to a non-controlled access facility (conventional highway), AASHTO standards shall prevail.** *If the local agency having jurisdiction over the local facility in question maintains standards that exceed AASHTO standards, then the local agency standards should prevail.* The major considerations in horizontal alignment design are safety, profile, type of facility, design speed, geotechnical features, topography, right of way cost and construction cost. In design, safety is always considered, either directly or indirectly. On freeways in metropolitan areas, alternative studies often indicate that right of way considerations influence alignment more than any other single factor. Topography controls both curve radius and design speed to a large extent. The design speed, in turn, controls sight distance, but sight distance must be considered concurrently with topography because it often demands a larger radius than the design speed. All these factors must be balanced to produce an alignment which optimizes the achievement of various objectives such as safety, cost, harmony with the natural contour of the land, and at the same time adequate for the design classification of the highway. **Horizontal alignment shall provide at least the minimum stopping sight distance for the chosen design speed at all points on the highway, as given in Table 201.1 and explained in Index 201.3.** See Index 101.1 for technical reductions in design speed.

todo!() Do something with this diagram.  
  
### 203.2 Standards for Curvature  
**Tables 202.2A through 202.2E shall be the minimum radius of curve for superelevation rates and design speeds on highways.** These tables are based upon the relationship between design speed and curvature and on their joint relationship with superelevation and side friction. Though these relationships originate from the laws of mechanics, the actual values for use in design depend on practical limits and factors determined empirically. *If the minimum radii indicated in Tables 202.2A through 202.2E do not provide the desired lateral clearance to an obstruction, Figure 201.6 shall govern.* See Index 202.2(1) for further information regarding the use of the tables. Every effort should be made to exceed minimum radii values for the emax of the table being used. Such minimum radii should be used only when the cost or other adverse effects of realizing a higher standard are inconsistent with the benefits. Use of Figure 202.2, in lieu of the above standards must be documented as discussed in Index 82.2. The recommended minimum radii for freeways are 5,000 feet in rural areas and 3,000 feet in urban areas. If a glare screen or a median barrier is contemplated, either initially or ultimately, adjustments may be necessary to maintain the required sight distance on curves on divided highways. In such cases, a larger curve radius or a wider median may be required throughout the length of the curve. For design purposes, a planting screen is presumed to be 8 feet wide. See Traffic Safety Systems Guidance for glare screen criteria.  
  
### 203.3 Alignment Consistency  
Sudden reductions in alignment standards should be avoided. *Where physical restrictions on curve radius cannot be overcome and it becomes necessary to introduce curvature of lower standard than the design speed for the project, the design speed between successive curves should change not more than 10 miles per hour. Introduction of curves with lower design speeds should be avoided at the end of long tangents, steep downgrades, or at other locations where high approach speeds may be anticipated.* The horizontal and vertical alignments should be coordinated such that horizontal curves are not hidden behind crest vertical curves. Sharp horizontal curves should not follow long tangents because some drivers tend to develop higher speeds on the tangent and could over drive the curve. See “Combination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignment” in Chapter 3 of AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, for further guidance on alignment consistency. 203.4 Curve Length and Central Angle The minimum curve length for central angles less than 10 degrees should be 800 feet to avoid the appearance of a kink. For central angles larger than 30 minutes, a curve is required without exception. Above a 20,000-foot radius, a parabolic curve may be used. Sight distance or other safety considerations are not to be sacrificed to meet the above requirements. On 2-lane roads a curve should not exceed a length of one-half mile and should be no shorter than 500 feet.  
  
### 203.5 Compound Curves  
Compound curves should be avoided because drivers who have adjusted to the first curve could over drive the second curve if the second curve has a smaller radius than the first. Exceptions can occur in mountainous terrain or other situations where use of a simple curve would result in excessive cost. *Where compound curves are necessary, the shorter radius should be at least two-thirds the longer radius when the shorter radius is 1,000 feet or less. On one-way roads, the larger radius should follow the smaller radius.* The total arc length of a compound curve should be not less than 500 feet.  
  
### 203.6 Reversing Curves  
When horizontal curves reverse direction the connecting tangents should be long enough to accommodate the standard superelevation runoffs given on Figure 202.5A. If this is not possible, the 6 percent per 100 feet rate of change should govern (see Index 202.5(3)). When feasible, a minimum of 400 feet of tangent should be considered.  
  
### 203.7 Broken Back Curves  
A broken back curve consists of two curves in the same direction joined by a short tangent. Broken back curves are unsightly and undesirable.  
  
### 203.8 Spiral Transition  
Spiral transitions are used to transition from a tangent alignment to a circular curve and between circular curves of unequal radius. Spiral transitions may be used whenever the traffic lane width is less than 12 feet, the posted speed is greater than 45 miles per hour, and the superelevation rate exceeds 8 percent. The length of spiral should be the same as the Superelevation Runoff Length shown in Figure 202.5A. In the typical design, full superelevation occurs where the spiral curve meets the circular curve, with crown runoff being handled per Figure 202.5A. For a general discussion of spiral transitions see AASHTO A Policy on the Geometric Design of Streets and Highways. When used, spirals transitions should conform to the Clothoid definition.  
  
### 203.9 Alignment at Bridges  
Due to the difficulty in constructing bridges with superelevation rates greater than 10 percent, the curve radii on bridges should be designed to accommodate superelevation rates of 10 percent or less. See Index 202.2 for standard superelevation rates. Superelevation transitions on bridges are difficult to construct and almost always result in an unsightly appearance of the bridge and the bridge railing. Therefore, if possible, horizontal curves should begin and end a sufficient distance from the bridge so that no part of the superelevation transition extends onto the bridge. Alignment and safety considerations, however, are paramount and must not be sacrificed to meet the above criteria.  
  
## Topic 204 – Grade  
### 204.1 General Controls  
The grade line is a reference line by which the elevation of the pavement and other features of the highway are established. It is controlled mainly by topography, type of highway, horizontal alignment, performance of heavy vehicles, right of way costs, safety, sight distance, construction costs, cultural development, drainage, and pleasing appearance. All portions of the grade line must meet sight distance requirements for the design speed classification of the road. In flat terrain, the elevation of the grade line is often controlled by drainage considerations. In rolling terrain, some undulation in the grade line is often advantageous for construction economy. This should be done with appearance in mind; for example, a grade line on tangent alignment exhibiting a series of humps visible for some distance ahead should be avoided whenever possible. In rolling hills or mountainous terrain, however, the grade line usually is more closely dependent upon physical controls. In considering alternative profiles, economic comparisons involving earthwork quantities and/or retaining walls should be made. A balanced earthwork design is most cost effective. When long or steep grades are involved, economic comparisons should include vehicle operating costs. The standards in Topic 204 also apply to portions of local streets and roads within the State right of way which connect directly to a freeway or expressway, or are expected to do so in the foreseeable future. For local facilities which are within the State right of way and where there is no connection or the connection is to a non-controlled access facility (conventional highway), AASHTO standards shall prevail. If the local agency having jurisdiction over the local facility in question maintains standards that exceed AASHTO standards, then the local agency standards should prevail.  
  
### 204.2 Position With Respect to Cross Section  
The grade line should generally coincide with the axis of rotation for superelevation (see Index 202.4). Its relation to the cross section should be as follows:  
	(1) Undivided Highways. The grade line should coincide with the highway centerline.  
	(2) Ramps and Freeway-to-freeway Connections. Although the grade line is usually positioned at the left edge of traveled way, either edge of traveled way or centerline may be used on multilane facilities.  
	(3) Divided Highways. The grade line should be positioned at the centerline of the median for paved medians 65 feet wide or less, thus avoiding a “saw tooth” section, which can reduce horizontal stopping sight distance.  
The grade line may be positioned at the ultimate median edge of traveled way when: [1]  
	(a) The median edges of traveled way of the two roadways are at equal elevation.  
	(b) The two roadways are at different elevations as described in Index 204.8.  
	(c) The width of median is nonuniform (see Index 305.6).  
  
### 204.3 Standards for Grade [G] 
**Table 204.3 shows the maximum grades which shall not be exceeded for the condition indicated.** Steep grades affect truck speeds and overall capacity. They also cause operational problems at intersections. For these reasons it is desirable to provide the flattest grades practicable (see Index 204.5 for information on truck issues with grades).

*Minimum grades should be 0.5 percent in snow country and 0.3 percent at other locations.* Except for conventional highways in urban or suburban areas, a level grade line is permissible in level terrain where side fill slopes are 4:1 or flatter and dikes are not needed to carry water in the roadbed. Flat grades are not permissible in superelevation transitions due to flat spots which cause ponding on the roadbed. *Ramp grades should not exceed 8 percent.* On descending on-ramps and ascending offramps, one percent steeper is allowed (see Index 504.2(5)).  
  
### 204.4 Vertical Curves  
Properly designed vertical curves should provide adequate sight distance, safety, comfortable driving, good drainage, and pleasing appearance. A parabolic vertical curve is used. Figure 204.4 gives all necessary mathematical relations for computing a vertical curve, either at crests or sags. *For algebraic grade differences of 2 percent and greater, and design speeds equal to or greater than 40 miles per hour, the minimum length of vertical curve in feet should be equal to 10V, where V = design speed.* As an example, a 65 miles per hour design speed would require a 650-foot minimum vertical curve length. *For algebraic grade differences of less than 2 percent, or design speeds less than 40 miles per hour, the vertical curve length should be a minimum of 200 feet.* Vertical curves are not required where the algebraic difference in grades is 0.5 percent or less.
